The Aztec is an interesting spicy change of pace. Sometimes when supplies run out I have had to make do with other brands and you can just tell the difference if like a really chocolaty taste.

50044,0,11.0,Female,2.0,0,22.0,1.0,1.0,186.86,"Nutritional value is ""meh,"" but my kid loves these things","Like the title of my review says, these little puffs aren't much different from run-of-the-mill Cheerios in terms of their healthiness--though they are somewhat better--but our little man (15 months old as of this date) absolutely loves them.  They are pretty unsubstantial, so he can snack away on them without fear of ruining his dinner appetite.  Other things that I like:<br /><br />  1) They're organic.  I don't know how many pesticide molecules are finding their way into a box of Cheerios, but my guess is not many!  Still, I like that these are organic.  Every little bit helps, right?<br /><br />  2) They dissolve very quickly so there's never any fear of choking no matter how many he stuffs in at once.<br /><br />  3) The container is more convenient that a box of cereal.<br /><br />  4) Like I said before, my son really enjoys these.<br /><br />In terms of health value, I find them to be similar to Cheerios.  If you adjust for the weight or volume differences, comparing the nutritional information shows that the Cheerios have more vitamins and fiber, but also more sugar and sodium.  Though none of these amounts are really significant concerns to me. For example, a half cup of Cheerios has .7g of Sugar while the HB Puffs have 0.<br /><br />Now for the one negative--the real kicker--and the reason why I am giving this very good product just 4 stars.  Purchasing these from Amazon (6-pack, as of July 20, 2011) will cost you about $1.47/ounce.  Purchasing a 14oz box of Cheerios from Amazon on the other hand is just 21 cents/oz.  The HB Organic puffs are 7X more expensive! (And of course, getting a 19lb box at Costco changes the equation further). But unless you're giving your kid a ton of these, or you're feeding multiple kids, the price difference probably isn't a deal breaker.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'd try them both and see which your little sprout goes for.  Can't really go wrong in either case.",0.92

I can't really tell if my dogs coats are better or they are more healthy.  On paper it seems to be the best food and it makes sense.  The food is sooo expensive and they jacked up the price about 6 months ago.  It does help they seem to eat half as much as my old dog food.  So, that cuts the cost in half compared to my old food.  A big bonus of this is there is half as much poop to pick up. That is huge as I am really lazy.  The other thing I noticed is both dogs had some nasty farts.  That pretty much stopped on Orijen.  Oddly my buddy said it will get worse with the higher protein diet, but it got a ton better.  I mean by dogs could drop some room clearing farts.  There are cheaper good dog foods out there like Blue.  I have thought about switching to it because it is 30 bucks a bag cheaper.  For now Evo is worth the money.

Although the full fat California naturals can be a favorite it really is fattening for indoor cats and they do not care for the low fat variety.<br />I feel satisfied because this is a healthy choice. There was one bowl that I removed from the test: Meow Mix, because they put something in it besides cornmeal and other questionable by-products, that act as an addictive. They can have Meow-Mix as a treat also, until they use of the bag.<br />So, my cats-- two adult (consenting) males and one kitten-- vote for natural Balance.<br />Thank you",0.6

It is simply the spices and seasonings you add to the quesadilla recipe on the package. So you'll need extra ingredients. And once you've made one quesadilla casserole, you don't have to buy the packets again. Why? Well...see below.<br /><br />First, consider the price ($6.99 at the current time). That's hefty for a few teaspoons of seasonings! By the way, I've also tried Mccormick Recipe Inspirations for Rosemary Roasted Chicken with Potatoes and while it was delicious, I didn't need to Inspirations package to create the exact same meal the next time around.<br /><br />Why? Because McCormicks lists each ingredient (in that case, paprika, crushed rosemary leaves, garlic and ground black pepper) and even notes the required amount of teaspoons to use for each spice or seasoning. So all you really have to do is save the back of the Inspirations packages and you can create the same meals - at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Yes, it may cost more the first time you purchase an entire box or jar of spices. But you'll end up saving money in the long run because they'll last far longer, making them far more economical. So by all means, grab a couple of the Inspirations seasoning packets to get the recipes for some yummy meals. After that, you can easily recreate the results. After all, it is all spelled out for you.",0.65

Sealed in convenient single-dose foil pouches, this coffee fits that bill admirably.<br /><br />Marley is a name I associate with Jamaica, home of some of the world's best coffee.  This coffee isn't Jamaican, though; it's an Ethiopian medium roast, ground and put into a little multi-purpose sealed filter.

Or, it can be torn open and the  ground coffee used any way you wish.<br /><br />I generally tend to like a fairly weak brew compared to my coffee-hound friends; this is enough grounds for me to make 12 oz of coffee, not more.  The flavor is not particularly dynamic; there's no French-roast ""burnt"" flavor but little of the floral or buttery aromatics that I like in my light roasts- as stated, it's a 'medium' roast.

I'm guessing because so many were disappointed by the taste of the original.  I never tried the original powder, because the reviews were too detrimental.  I knew I would hate it and didn't want to invest.  While this is not glass of chocolate milk, the dark chocolate flavor is what hits the taste buds first.  There is still the grass flavor...but I don't mind that taste.  It's lightly sweetened, but has only 11g of sugar per serving which is less than half of what's in the original powder.  34g of protein and loaded with vitamins and minerals.  I felt full after drinking 1/2 serving.  I only give  4 stars because it gets super duper thick within minutes which makes it hard to get down.  I bought the powder to be my meal on the go that I can carry all day and sip to keep my blood sugar and hunger under control.  Hard to do when it becomes a custard like consistency.  I read that adding more liquid does the trick.  But I mixed mine with almond/coconut milk and didn't have it on hand.  I will try to use water tomorrow.  Try the product.

(oddly enough, the random squirrel doesn't phase them)I like these Zoe Dental Chew Bones - no corn, no wheat and no soy.<br /><br /> When the bag was first opened, the smell of roasted chicken wafted out - good first impression! They don't feel particularly greasy to the touch, yet clearly have a flavored coating. I passed one out to each dog and they went to their respective beds to knaw away. The Ridgebacks can burn through other brands of similar type chews within a few bites, so I expected the same thing here. They actually took about 10 minutes to finish one of these Zoe bones and not one dog walked away to see if the other dogs had something better. That was astonishing - these are hounds and they always assume someone else has something better than they were given.

In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A"">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0"">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As far as which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.",0.71

I drink a lot of Crystal Light, but it takes a while to get used to the idea that the lemonade flavor doesn't taste like lemonade, for example.<br /><br />I love the idea of the Mocktails.  There are times I'd love to have something that tastes like a margarita, but has no alcohol and no calories.  When I look closely at that statement, well, it's pretty obvious that I'm just not living in the real world.<br /><br />The margarita mocktail has a vague passing resemblance to a very watered-down, inoffensive and politically correct margarita, and I suppose that is, more or less, what it is.  Honestly, I rather like the taste.  I like it better than Crystal Light lemonade and it beats the socks off Crystal Light pink lemonade.  And it is a really lovely color, a pale apple green, rather margarita-colored, when you think about it.<br /><br />Pro:  Tastes nice, few calories, pretty color, no alcohol of course<br />Con: If your taste buds are all primed for a margarita, this drink will not satisfy and you may find yourself adding things like margarita mix and tequila, which kind of misses the point.",0.4

Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS).  I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives, Purina and Friskies.<br /><br />I continued with IAMS and Science Diet, because the other brands caused FUS, caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet.<br /><br />Then last year, one of our cats developed bladder disease and died.<br /><br />Not long afterward, the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company, including premium foods like IAMS and Science, were tainted by melamine.  More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled.  IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands, as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro.<br /><br />I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust.  I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic.  Newman's Own is both natural and organic.  It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source, I finally found a few, including Amazon.<br /><br />My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food.  They also love Innova EVO.  I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Peace of mind<br />2. Does not cause FUS, as did Purina and other similar brands<br />3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants<br />4. The cats love it<br />5. Does not cause the other digestive problems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands<br />2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own.<br /><br />Overall, the pros outweigh the cons.  And I can now add Amazon to my list of sources for the food.",0.52

We spread this Foie Gras on toast and also cooked some on top of deer tenderloin & backstrap. I think this Fois Gras is the closest you'll get to the traditional French Foie Gras.

This helped cut down on the sweetness of the cookie (as I feel most mixes are too sweet). Adding these ingredients produced a soft, chewy, somewhat cake like cookie.<br /><br />These cookies were not quite up to the same standard as some of the wonderful bakeries in NY, but definitely good enough for gift giving or a household gathering (far better than some of the mixes that cove in a pouch with a red spoon logo).",0.85

These are cut a little finer than the regular steel cuts, which would probably account for the quicker cooking time.<br /><br />For the consumer who has previously tried steel cut oats and Scottish oatmeal, the texture of these oats are in between the two.  They're not cut quite as fine as Scottish oats, but they're definitely cut finer than regular steel cuts.<br /><br />Overall, these are definitely worth a try.

These are all non-caffeine, high antioxidant herbal teas that are always startling delicious to anyone I have served them too.<br /><br />Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, including those with black tea and those with green tea. The ones I discuss here are my personal favorites.<br /><br />Wissotzky Teas are rather renowned though, personally, I hadn't heard of them until I was teaching at my University's summer law program at University of Haifa in Israel. You pick them up at any supermarket there -- but you have to special order them over here in the US.<br /><br />Having to live in dormitory-style living while teaching over there, the tea was convenient but I was most startled by how really delicious it was. I am not a big tea drinker -- occasionally herbal tea in the winter -- but I was drinking this tea every day during the very hot Israeli summer.<br /><br />I brought quite a bit back with me and ordered more here. I often offered it to colleagues during meetings in my office and they were invariably struck by how unexpectedly delicious it is.<br /><br />So now I give boxes as gifts. And the recipients often hint they wouldn't mind another gift they so love it.<br /><br />Serving the tea at one of my group work meetings has become a hallmark tradition and puts a positive tone as we launch into a 3 hour work session.<br /><br />For more information:<br />These herbal teas are made from the Rooibus (Red Bush) plant from South Africa.<br /><br />The only authentic Rooibus tea is from South Africa -- though many companies claim theirs is Rooibus though not from South Africa.<br /><br />It is not unlike that genuine Champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France but firms market sparkling wines from other regions prepared by the ""Methode Champenoise."" In that case, there are excellent Methode Champenoise sparkling wines that rival genuine Champagne (though being a champagne lover -- I still find a taste unique to genuine Champagne.)<br /><br />However my experience is that non-South African Rooibus Tea is not as good nor does it have the medicinal and homeopathic qualities that genuine Rooibus tea does.<br /><br />As to the variations: Wissotzky sells the pure Rooibus Tea (which does not seem to be here on Amazon) and 3 flavored versions: 1. with Chamomile, Lime & Honey,[[B0041R1UM0 Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (my and most people's favorite)  2. with Cinnamon & Vanilla <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R00WG"">Wissotzky Red Tea with Cinnamon and Vanilla, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>(my second most favorite and many people's first choice) and 3. with Rosehip & Passion Fruit <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1DYA"">Wissotzky Red Tea with Rosehip and Passion fruit, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (which I also really like and again is some people's favorites.)<br /><br />As mentioned at the start of this review -- Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, both with and without flavors, herbal, black tea and green tea (which has its own homeopathic benefits.)

My memories of it were not terribly fond though, as it was always soupy and weak. We always had to dump on the brown sugar or maple syrup to give it any flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />I continued to buy instant oatmeal through college and into adulthood, but would always use far less water than called for on the package, mainly just to give it some texture. I thought that was the best oatmeal could get.<br /><br />Then one day someone made me a bowl of steel cut oatmeal, and it was seriously like Oatmeal reinvented! For one it looks nothing like rolled oats--instead of flat little flakes these are like little pellets. When cooked, steel cut oatmeal gets an awesome ""al dente"" consistency that is both smooth and chewy. But more importantly, steel cut oatmeal has a wonderful rich flavor I've never tasted in rolled oats. I find that with this I only add a very minimal amount of sweetener (usually maple syrup but honey also works). Sometimes I add some cranberries or fresh blueberries if I have them, but it is perfectly delicious sans extras.<br /><br />Yes, it takes preparation, but it's the best use of my rice cooker I've found (ironically I use it more for oatmeal than I do for rice!). I just pour in the oatmeal and water the night before, set the cooker to porridge mode and set the timer for whatever time I want to eat. In the morning, I wake up to the wonderful smell of the cooking oats and by the time I'm dressed and ready for breakfast, they're all ready to go.<br /><br />I can't recommend these highly enough.

It was clear they were already broken before being put into the delivery box, it's hard to believe somebody will knowingly ship crushed boxes to customers. As I tried to clean up the tapes and wrapping, dark tea power made a complete mess in the kitchen.<br /><br />At that point I was still hopeful, after all it's the tea not the packaging we buy. Unfortunately the first taste didn't do much for me, it was nothing special, less flavorful than a lot of regular brands. There were two things that should serve as indicators: 1) I looked at the expiry date it's in 2011, no manufacturing date shown; 2) Each large thin paper box holds 240 loose bags, compared to some other brands that have much better packaging to preserve the flavor. The regular 48 bag box I buy has two foil packs inside.<br /><br />To summarize, I got two big crushed boxes for a total of 480 loose tea bags, some of them are in power form no longer contained in bags.

When I went into the local pet store and asked for a busy box for my 100# lab mix, they sold me the Bouncy Bone. It took my dog less than 10 minutes to figure out that he could just grab the ring with his canines, while pinning the ball to the ground with his paws on the nylon bone on either side, and just using brute force to pull the ring until it snaps off. Gone in less than a minute. He's not interested in chewing on the nylon ends, and he could care less about that large heavy ball. Can't say I blame him.<br /><br />I started cutting thick chews in half and drilling a hole through the center, larger than the core of the toy. Sandwiching the gnawhide ring between the pieces slowed him down considerably, since he had to chew through a substantial amount of rawhide to get to the gnawhide.<br /><br />My next investment was the Bristle Bone (uses the same rings). If you haven't completed your toy purchase, get this one. It cleans their teeth, massages their gums, and conceals everything but the edge of the ring. Within 5 minutes he had cracked the middle piece that houses the bristles with his powerful jaws. The toy is still usable, although it does lose bristles. However, it only slowed him down by a few minutes.<br /><br />Now I cut 3/8"" off the outside of the rings, and cut that into smaller pieces to hide between the bristles on the other side, and use as special mini-treats. (I'm too cheap to use more than one ring at a time.) By doing this I am assured of at least 30 minutes to two hours. He's also pretty worn out from all the licking and biting.",-0.64

One a day worked just perfectly (well for six days since there are six to a box).  Tasty, moderately healthy, and reasonably filling, this is a good bar.<br /><br />The taste is definitely one of chocolate coconut.  the chocolate is actually a layer in the top and while it's not the darkest chocolate I've ever had (closer to milk chocolate) it was still pretty good.  I kind of liked the chewy frosting like texture it was in too.  The coconut sprinkle on top you could also taste and that combined with the nuts and the actual granola bar made a pretty satisfying bite.  You could taste all the different flavors without any becoming too overpowering.  I might have wished for just a little more coconut, but I won't complain too much since I could taste it.<br /><br />The ingredients are pretty decent. It's sweetened with rice syrup and cane sugar, so natural at least.  The grains are the most prominent ingredient, with wheat, oat, rye, and barley being listed.  There's also the coconut of course, and the chocolate.  And it contains the Kashi seven whole grains mix that they like to advertise.  And walnuts appeared to be the nut of choice on this bar.  Really, every ingredient in there I can pronounce and that's a win in my book.  The calories are moderate for these ingredients, 120 a bar, which is a lot less than the protein bars that are on the market.  And the sugar content is only 7 grams, which is also relatively low.  Fat is 3.5 grams, which is ok.  And there is 4 grams of protein.<br /><br />Not a bad bar and definitely a good breakfast.  I'll be buying these again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",0.98

50314,0,8.0,Male,3.0,1,12.0,1.0,0.0,176.32,Great if Brewed Right,"Gyokuro as simply the best tasting tea we've tasted - and we've tasted plenty.  I've had this tea (English Tea Stores brand) and the Teavana brand Gyokuro.  I'd say both are excellent teas.  The Teavana brand is definitely a higher grade tea.  This can mostly be discerned from the slightly more illustrious flavor that the Teavana Gyokuro provides.  Additionally, the English Tea Stores brand tends to be less forgiving of improper brewing temperature - it gets bitter easier.  I noticed that the English Tea Stores brand tended to be a little drier and more brittle.  Teavana gets the tea into your hands while the leaves are still *moist* and in whole strips.  The English Tea Stores Gyokuro was starting to crumble and you will end up with more sediment in your tea.<br /><br />Once we started brewing the English Tea Stores brand Gyokuro in our new Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless-Steel Cordless Electric Kettle, the tea came out acceptably close to Teavana's Gyokuro.  The flavor is outstanding in both cases.  Over time, our purchase of the Electric Kettle will pay for itself because the English Tea Stores brand is much cheaper.  Now we can enjoy the wonderful flavor of Japans greatest tea all the time without emptying our pockets on the best of the best Teavana Gyokuro.  If you do use the Electric Kettle: we use 2 tablespoons of tea (could use less for a milder brew), set the kettle for green tea, put the tea in the water then set a timer for 30 seconds, then remove when the timer goes off.  We also use a cast-iron tea pot that we preheat with a little bit of the water from the kettle, so that might make a difference as well.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is an acceptable replacement to the Teavana brand teas.  If you have the money to buy the tea you want, stick with Teavana.  If you are on a tighter budget, the English Tea Stores is an acceptable trade off if you brew it properly.<br /><br />Ps. The Cuisinart tea pot is AWESOME!<br /><br />- Gyokuro Devotee",0.89

When you pour the litter on top of the strainer tray, some of the clean litter sifts through and the cats end up with half of the clean litter originally put in. The clumping litter makes solids adhere to the underside of the strainer tray. You have to bang it against something to get the dirty litter off. As you do this, litter sprays around the floor -- no matter how hard you try to be neat, adding an additional ""sweeping step"" to the whole procedure. Also, the litter you have ""strained"" weighs in pretty hefty when you're crouched on the floor lifting and sifting the entire tray of litter daily! So, I say, if you just scoop it daily with a regular scoop, you will get the job done in half the time, with half the mess and half the trouble. I'm going back to the old method.",0.48

50340,0,10.0,Female,2.0,0,17.0,1.0,2.0,174.91,Please understand what it means to go grain free.....,"This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Cost<br />All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br /><br />Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br /><br />Smell<br />Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br /><br />Taste<br />Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br /><br />Poop<br />When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the ""Whole 30"" and see what I mean.<br /><br />Switching to Grain Free<br />Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br /><br />BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.",0.57

After researching formulas, we started with Similac organic since it is easiest to find in stores.  We were supplementing with formula, so I wasn't overly concerned about the sugar.  After a few weeks, we noticed that our baby was regularly constipated, and it took about a week (and reading reviews on amazon) to put it together. I moved over to Earth's best and within days, she was back to normal.  I couldn't believe it!<br /><br />That said, I do have a one small problem with this formula.

The formula rep called me back and explained that the formula was fine, but the smell can sometimes be unpleasant.  My baby wouldn't drink it!  They were very nice to deal with and refunded my money.  I also looked online and read that Earth's best was pulled from the shelves in 2007 for the same problem.  From what I learned, cans that sit on shelves too long can get that smell.  I had to go to 4 stores to find another can, since the local Target only had cans from the lot with the funny smell.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with Earth's best and will continue to use it.",0.5

It is more salty than I prefer, but I think most people would like that level of saltiness.  My only real complaint is that it is super expensive.

In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company.",0.53

My cousin washes her face with this every morning and evening and it completely cleared up her acne, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The main reason i wanted to right this review though is because i recently had to have a spot that looked like skin cancer on my back removed and the instructions to take care of it were to cleanse and put vaseline and a new bandage on it twice a day.  Ofcourse, it got infected after about a week and a half even though I was following the instructions (telling someone to put vaseline on that kind of wound to heal is dumb anyway and should not have followed that).  I'm not prone to getting infections in cuts and what not and usually heal pretty quickly so I was surprised. When I called the dermatologist they told me I had to take antibiotics. I don't feel that antibiotics are always necessary for an infection and decided to try to heal this by myself first and if absolutely necessary turn to antibiotics. I decided to put the raw honey on it after I cleansed, it actually has almost the exact same texture as vaseline and after about an hour of it being on it started to feel itchy and like it was healing.  I woke up the next morning and it already looked so much better.  I'm on day three of doing this and it looks like it is almost healed. This honey has basically healed and cured an infection which is amazing and I believe that this product actually has all the enzymes, vitamins, and antibacterial properties it says it has.

I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far.

So don't buy it for its taste but at the same time don't NOT buy it for its taste.<br /><br />If you're purchasing Essentia is is probably for the ""health benefits.""

50436,0,7.0,Female,2.0,0,14.0,1.0,0.0,151.21,Everything's growing with my Aerogrow!,"Well, I'd always wanted to try one of these and when Amazon.com had a sale, I talked my husband into it.<br /><br />So far, I have to say all is well and the product looks nice and is performing just as advertised. Every herb plant (from the Gourmet Herb seed pod kit that came with it) came up and before the full time allotted ran out. Most were nicely ahead of schedule. I am just about to the end of the first two week germination period, so we'll see if the ""add nutrient"" lights come on properly.<br /><br />The unit has been through several short power failures and nothing has disrupted the scheduling of the lights going on and off at the proper times. The light is bright, yes... but not so bright as a sunny window. My unit is in a finished basement room where I can keep it shut away from my plant-destroying young cats. Were it not for the cats, it *would* be on my kitchen counter! However, before you buy one, you should be sure you have a good place to keep it and won't be bothered by the light. It is on 17 hours a day during the herb cycle. Me, I like light.<br /><br />We did have one scare, when my husband smelled a burning smell coming from the unit one night. The smell was completely gone by morning when he told me about it and I checked the unit but I called Customer Service anyway. I was pleasantly surprised not to have to wait on hold. They said that sometimes there is a coating on the plastic that burns off within the first 3-4 days. OK... this happened perhaps just past that point, at about 4-5 days, so I assume it was just what they said. No further instances of strange smells since. Still, it was quite worrisome at the time, so I could wish the company might mention this possible occurrence in the manual so one might be prepared! They did give me a quick way to check and be sure it wasn't my pump burnt out... and it clearly wasn't. So I felt safe continuing to run the unit and appreciated the quick help. The pump has so far been VERY quiet, almost silent, actually.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing how my herbs grow. If they do well, I think I'll start looking for a place to put a secondary and possibly a third unit. Perhaps using one of those accessory wall stands. The one drawback of course is that you get hooked into needing to buy their seed or master gardener kits, their nutrient tablets and their grow bulbs (which are supposed to be replaced at six month intervals). So this is probably NOT the most cost effective way to grow. OTOH... I can look forward to basil that is not half-destroyed by earwigs! And FRESH herbs when all is frozen and brown outside. It's surely an EASY way to garden!<br /><br />Update: April 2010<br /><br />Still using my Aerogarden Classic! That first herb garden was wildly successful! In fact, I've bought more and currently have NINE assorted Aerogardens! On the cat issue, I've found that the cats don't go after my herbs, just lettuce. So I *do* have an Aerogarden growing herbs in the kitchen now. Any gardens the cats might bother or where I might be growing a plant that is toxic for cats stays in my basement room. I'm harvesting abundant basil, dill, thyme and cilantro at the moment.<br /><br />I mostly do my own seeds now, using Park Seed bio-sponges, General Hydroponics Flora series liquid nutrients and making my own labels. I save and reuse all the plastic pod baskets I have received with various seed kits. It's more economic than buying extra Aerogarden supplies. At any rate, this first Classic garden is continuing to function beautifully, no pump failures or any issues, though I do keep a spare pump on hand. I replace the bulbs once a year. I have a mixed romaine/endive/arugula/chervil garden that has recently sprouted and growing right now. I've also used this original garden with the Aerogarden Seed Starter Tray and that works very well too. I'm a happy Aerogardener!<br /><br />My favorite Aerogardens are the tall gardens <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L6GFC8"">AeroGarden 900380-1200 VeggiePro for Full-Sized Vegetables</a>, but I'm also fond of the little 3-pod gardens, which are super for flowers. I've grown tomatoes, green beans, chard, lettuce, greens, baby bok choy, petunias and various herbs in my gardens so far. I'm trying baby bell peppers right now, though those have just sprouted. For those needing help or ideas for their gardens, I highly recommend the Aerogarden Growers Community Forum.<br /><br />Update: May 2010<br /><br />On harvests... don't expect a single Aerogarden to provide for a large family. However, if I harvest heavily, I can usually get about 100g of lettuce (enough to fill two large pasta bowls or make 3-4 smaller side salads) about every 5 days or so. I get even larger amounts of chard weekly and it is fresh and tender and mild enough to eat raw. Herb gardens do provide fairly abundant harvests, it's difficult sometimes for hubby and I to keep up with the garden! However, the fact that it produces so well does encourage me to use a lot of fresh herbs! Overall, I definitely feel my Aerogardens contribute to healthier eating! And I use the extra spillover light to help start other plants for outdoors. And grow cat grass.",0.94

Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.

Especially if it's made out of food.  :)  I put the treats in the ball thing and she licked it a couple times and lost interest.  The problem with this toy is that it's hard for the dogs to get a grip on the thing.  The shape is putting them off.  She later tried to knaw on it with the side of her jaw, but got so little out of it (a taste but nothing to chew on or savor or act like a reward) that she lost interest - which is saying a lot, since again she will go to great lengths for the smallest crumb.<br /><br />Finally, I took the treats out of the ball and offered them to the dogs - instand results.  They are working away at them right now.  I think the lesson here is that this toy will only work well for dogs that enjoy chewing on hard objects that don't break into pieces easily if they do at all.  Some dogs love this!  Not mine, apparently.<br /><br />So if anyone wants to try it with their dogs, email me.  I have one, never been chewed!  Maybe your dog will like it more than mine.  Five bucks!  ;)",-0.59

That said, buy treats for your dogs, if that's who will be eating them, not yourself.<br /><br />My larger dogs (70#, excellent teeth, and 30#, bad teeth) inhaled these chews, taking just a little longer than they would take to eat fresh meat.  For this price, chews have to last a bit longer.<br /><br />I do not understand how the chews could be considered ""hard"" if used straight from the package.  YMMV.  My Chihuahua took two days to eat his.  He left a mess.  The bigger dogs didn't.<br /><br />My larger, 55# and underweight, young girl dog would not touch these chews on two different days.

I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I've tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you've had good vanilla you'll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don't think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested)",0.89

I'm much more likely to purchase organic coffee in the first place. Combine that factor with the high quality Arabica beans and the convenience of these pods and you have a spectacular product. Also, partial proceeds of the coffee sales go toward youth soccer programs in the 'Kicks for cause foundation' that helps keep children on the playground and not in sweatshops, etc. Although these pods are not quite right for my home coffee pot (we have too many individuals who need a cup of coffee in the morning), they are fantastic for our various trips. I use these pods in place of the hotel coffee pods they provide in the room (hotel coffee is often not very good where we usually stay). The Marley Coffee pods are often far more tear resistant than the cheap hotel coffee pods. I've also used some of the packets as a unique addition to birthday gifts for friends and family (what great stocking stuffers they'll make for my coffee drinking family members). I also love to grab a  Marley Coffee pod for just a single cup of coffee in the evening if I'm going to be up late at night writing (which happens often). Another strategic place for these pods are the hiking backpacks. My husband, Tony McVay, and I can easily throw these in a small boiling pan of water if we are camping on the Mountains to Sea Trail or the Appalachian Trail on the weekends. The grains stay in the pod and haven't broke open in the pot thus far. I can't wait to share a few packets with a 'thru-hiker' on the Appalachian Trail. Imagine a weary hiker's delight when they treat themselves to a great cup of organic coffee just before hitting another long day on the trail! On that note, they are in a water-proof, light weight packet that fits easily in a backpack, purse and my husband's tool box. If he has a cup and a microwave available it is possible to brew a cup of coffee, although they're not exactly like tea bags. I can't wait to visit Marleycoffee.com to see what other flavors they have to offer.

Hibiscus,"When i bought this product, I was expecting it to taste like Snapple's raspberry iced tea.<br /><br />Well, if you follow the instructions, this stuff does NOT taste like raspberry iced tea.  I use 2 bags of tea for about 16 ounces of water, and if it steeps more than about 5 minutes, it rapidly starts tasting much more like hibiscus flowers than raspberries.  Note that hibiscus is the #2 ingredient.  If you steep for less time, it tastes weak.<br /><br />To counteract this, and get a great batch of raspberry iced tea, add a little lemon juice.  I use about 1 tbsp for the 16 ounces of water.  This hides the hibiscus flavor and brings just a bit of tartness to make it taste more like wild raspberries.<br /><br />I knocked off 2 stars because it isn't easy for me to store lemon juice at work, and my objective with this tea was to save money and get a healthier drink for my afternoon caffeine fix.  It serves the purpose, but it is rather funny tasting without the lemon juice.",-0.48

It is a delicious licorice product that improves with age, in my opinion.

I was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal.

I had to finally give up and look for bags.  This product is great!  The nylon bags and fresh tasting tea do the trick!  You can even do the faux pas two steeps before trashing with a little flavor still coming out!  Even with water normally too hot for green teas, the result is a smooth, low tannin flavor.  There are a few downfalls, however...<br /><br />Although each tin has a generous amount of tea bags, there is NO air tight seal.  You rely on whatever reduction in air exchange through the tight fitting aluminum lid.  Once you open this 60-bag pack, therefore, try to drink it quickly.  If you drink a lot of tea, this may not be a problem.  Oxygen in the air catalyzes rapid degradation!<br /><br />That being said, the tea, so far, is still wonderful after a couple month of usage (down to 1 tin!).<br /><br />Another issue, I like my tea to have a little stronger flavor than these bags allow.  It may be a product of the amount of tea in the bags, but even steeping in boiling water for over 10 minutes does not extract a ton of flavor.  If you're looking for a VERY light tea, this will not be a problem for you.<br /><br />I've adjusted my drink schedule and switched to my strongly caffeinated, stoutly flavored coffee for workday mornings and this delightfully light tea for weekends.<br /><br />In summary, this tea is quite fresh and tasty with almost no bitter tannin flavor, though comes with no airtight seals and brews a little weak for me.

Picking up a bag the first chance I had, I wondered if the Mesquite Barbecue would match up to the great taste of regular Barbecue. Also, I've never truly liked Kettle Cooked chips, and always eat regular or baked if I have the chance over them. What it came to was that these new type of chips only had one thing going for them: I've always loved barbecue chips.<br /><br />Putting one into my mouth, I immediately noticed the difference it had--it was more seasoned than most Lays, and the fact that it was Kettle Cooked made it crunch in my mouth more heavily than normal chips would. The extra seasoning isn't bad though--although if you eat too many at one time you do get rather tired of eating them; the crunch, well loud, is thoroughly satisfying. The bag size isn't bad either--while it is smaller (or at least seems) than normal Lays chip bags, the extra flavor and overall quality make it worth it.<br /><br />In the end, these chips should be eaten like they're cooked: in small batches, and with quality food like them.

I have mixed feelings about it so far. The Rodeo Drive Blend is a little more 'bland' than I'm used to, which is great for people who prefer that. It's just a different taste, which is good or not-so-good, depending on each person's preference. Personally, ever so often I take a sip of Rodeo Drive Blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater. Then that goes away and I enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee. I think that reaction is because it isn't as strong and bold as I'm used to, but it's pretty good. I can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different.<br /><br />Will I buy this again? No. It's good, but it's not my preference, and I might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are, usually Tully's French, Kona, Italian, and House. Those may be too strong for some people, and the Rodeo Drive Blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers. As with most things, actually a little more than in most things, with coffee, it's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking.

It is a VERY fine powder that is black (roasted/charcoal eggplant) the directions have you wet your toothbrush and place it in the powder then ""brush"" your teeth and gums with it.  Fist off, I'd not place a toothbrush over and over into a container as this does not seem sanitary - and it blackens everything - brush, teeth, sink etc.... and the powder is fine and seems to get everywhere.  Instead I opted for using a Q-tip to apply the powder - still was very messy.  I can't speak to its medicinal properties as I was unable to get past the mess and taste. I had read positive reviews regarding healing properties - it seems this might be mostly due to the salt.<br /> Here is the write up off of the Eden site itself.<br />EDEN Dentie Toothpowder is a traditional Japanese tooth and gum powder, called 'denshi' in Japan. It was kept in every bathroom cabinet. In the 1960s George Ohsawa (1893 - 1966), the founder of modern macrobiotics, rediscovered Dentie and began recommending it to his students.<br />EDEN Dentie Toothpowder is made in Japan from only the calyx (stem) of Japanese eggplant and sea salt. The eggplant is first cleaned, the calyx and a bit of the vegetable is sliced away, then pickled with sea salt for a few weeks. When finished pickling, the eggplant is dry roasted until it is like charcoal. The charred eggplant is then ground to a fine powder, allowed to cool and packed. EDEN Dentie Toothpowder contains no chemicals, coloring agents, refined sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />Dentie Toothpowder's minerals keep the gums clean and firm, and counter bacteria that may lead to gum problems. Use it once or twice a week to help keep gums and teeth healthy. Simply moisten your fingers or a toothbrush and rub on gums. Leave it on for several minutes and rinse thoroughly. Dentie may also be added to water in a gargle occasionally for a sore throat. It is not recommended for vigorous or everyday brushing as it is abrasive.<br /><br />Please note: Do not use Dentie Toothpowder on open wounds as suggested in some older macrobiotic publications, as it may become embedded under the skin causing a bluish scar.",-0.77

I'm looking at the servings right now and for one container it has 29 g of sugar. I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them.<br /><br />When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up.<br /><br />I'd never tell anybody how to raise their kids (or what to drink themselves), but I for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet.

The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.

50684,0,2.0,Female,3.0,0,22.0,1.0,7.0,125.14,Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.",0.82

My only problem is that the string is attached to the middle of each bag vs. the end--which can be annoying--easier for it to slip into the cup while brewing (esp. if you're using a microwave to heat it) & also if you use a squeezing device to get the brewed tea out of the bag itself before disposing of it.

You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones.

Add 1/2 cup sour cream (or plain yogurt), 1/3 cup Splenda and 1 teaspoon of vanilla (other flavors such as almond, lemon or mint are good, too).  Mix Sans Sucre as directed and mix with cream cheese mixture.  If you want a thicker filling for a pie or preference, reduce milk in Sans Sucre to 1/4 cup.

We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good for adding to coffee to get the taste of Kahlua without the added calories, sugar or alcohol. This product adds no calories, no sugar, no carbohydrates and no cholesterol to your coffee.<br /><br />It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt. I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found.

The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.",-0.91

The Peter Rabbit Organics brand has a better taste, although with twice the sugar in some varieties, it's not hard to imagine why. The texture of the chia seeds is also annoying, but I put up with it because a) I already paid for it and b) they have Omega 3s, which are very good for you.<br /><br />With subscribe & save, I paid about a dollar per pouch, which isn't too bad.

50818,0,9.0,Female,3.0,0,12.0,1.0,7.0,170.94,Coffee Alternative,"I recently decided to give up coffee, including decaf, for health reasons. I drank coffee all day long, sometimes making a second pot in the early afternoon. I enjoy drinking a warm beverage throughout the day and wanted to find something to replace coffee. I buy a lot of things from Amazon.com and decided to start my search there. I found a number of products to choose from, and after reading the reviews, I decided on these three: Cafix, Caf-Lib, and Dandy Blend.<br /><br />The first thing you must do when trying any coffee substitute is to set your expectations. The reviews I read said these products tasted like coffee. They do not taste like any coffee I have ever had. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are expecting a coffee-like taste when you try one of these, you will be disappointed. That was my experience. I drank my coffee black, and so that is how I prepared these. Perhaps with sweetener and/or creamer these do taste more like coffee.<br /><br />I ordered all three products from Amazon.com, and the first to arrive was Cafix. Thinking it was like coffee, I used a level teaspoon just like I would with instant coffee. It tasted like really weak coffee. I tried adding more to make it stronger, but it still did not taste like coffee, and I was disappointed. I finished the drink and put my cup in the<br />dishwasher.<br /><br />After I thought about it for a while, I realized what I really wanted was a beverage I could drink throughout the day like I did coffee. Whether or not it tasted like coffee was not important. It's not that Cafix tasted bad, it wasn't what I was expecting. So I made myself another cup, and when I finished that one I made a third. By the end of the day I decided that Cafix wasn't so bad after all, I actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />A couple days later I received Caf-Lib and eagerly fixed myself a cup. First impression was good. Caf-Lib tastes similar to Cafix to me, but has more flavor. Caf-Lib is also stronger, so I use less to achieve the same strength. After comparing Cafix and Caf-Lib I decided that I prefer Caf-Lib.<br /><br />The next day Dandy Blend arrived, and I fixed myself a cup right away. The directions say to use a slightly rounded teaspoon for a strong coffee like drink, so that's what I did. Dandy Blend was a little slower to dissolve, requiring that I stir it longer. Not important really, just observation. Finally I took my first sip. To my amazement I found the taste<br />reminded me of Caf-Lib and Cafix. I think the reason is because none of them have the bitter taste of coffee. They are all very mild. Dandy Blend's has slightly more flavor Cafix, but not as much as Caf-Lib.<br /><br />#1: Caf-Lib<br />The most flavorful of these three and my favorite. I used one rounded teaspoon per cup. Has somewhat of a nut flavor.<br /><br />#2: Dandy Blend<br />I used a slightly rounded (almost level) teaspoon per cup. It has somewhat of a smokey smell while stirring. More flavor than Cafix, but not as much as Caf-Lib.<br /><br />#3: Cafix<br />I used one heaping teaspoon of per coffee cup. The taste is very mild.<br /><br />There are many factors to consider when choosing a beverage. I prefer to drink them black, while you may prefer to use creamer and/or sweetener. Only you can determine which one would you prefer with your favorite snack. The reviews are good as a starting point, but I suggest you try all three to discover which one you will enjoy the most.",0.62

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).

You know how most powdered milks are really only okay for baking or for emergencies?  That's not true for this stuff.  It tastes great - even when it's used alone.  It is rich and creamy.  It completely and easily dissolves in cold water - which isn't something that can be said about most powdered milk.  The best part is that it doesn't really taste processed and doesn't have any odd aftertaste.  I know what farm-fresh milk tastes like (my grandfather had a dairy farm) and even though I'm picky about my milk - even I still like this.<br /><br />My main reason for purchasing this is because I like to add it to hot cereals.  I can make grits, oatmeal, cream of rice, etc with water and then simply mix this in once I'm finished.  It is also perfect for adding to coffee, making homemade hot cocoa recipes, making yogurt, adding to recipes, etc.<br /><br />This has become a staple in my home.

So if you are looking for something to replace your diet soda to get away from artificial sweetners, you might like this.  Don't look for this to replace your full-sugar sodas.  It tastes COMPLETELY diet. Don't look for it to taste like the brand names out there, though.  The Dr. tastes like a cherry soda.  Personally I do not plan to buy these again.  Since I only drink a full-sugar soda maybe twice/week, I think I will stick with that for now.<br /><br />Edit: I brought this up a star since my brother likes it.

Many of the flexible dental spikes were also chewed off within the first hour. After a week of use, the main piece has some tears in it. My guess is that it will break off soon.<br /><br />The dogs really like it. One of them sat for two hours trying to get her treats out, so this was a worth while purchase in terms of a toy or  activity that actually keeps my dog busy. There was no tugging though. The dogs just sat and held it in their paws occaisionally rolling it to shift the treats around to get them out.<br /><br />This toy is really not that different than the Kongs that I have, which have survived two years of chewing!

You want healthy, eat a salad.<br /><br />Speaking of healthy, the Nongshim bowl proudly proclaims that it has 30% less sodium than their regular product and no MSG. But if you eat the whole thing you'll still be getting about 3/4 of your daily allotment of sodium (assuming a 2000 calorie diet) as well as artificial flavor and the usual cast of chemical names. As I mentioned, you would assume this much unless you just fell off a potato truck.<br /><br />All that said, I just didn't care for the Nongshim very much.

Over the years I've experimented with different brands and this one is not only my favorite but often much cheaper than some of the competing brands.  All good quality coconut milks will cook up the same, more or less.  What makes Chaokoh my favorite is that it usually has the most solids, aka ""cream"", per can, which is the secret to having a rich, thicker curry without resorting to extra starch.  Be sure you store the cans the way you received them (upside down or right side up) and always open from the top of the can as that will make it much easier to get all the cream out with the liquid rather than having to try and scrape it from the bottom (or opening both ends).  Very creamy with no grit or chunks, great ""real"" coconut flavor.  A must for any Thai cooking at home!  Yes, I've had a few dented cans too but really, what's the problem?

This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.  Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options.<br /><br />TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same.",0.48

I didn't want to ship the whole order back so I just used the ones in the order (from the ""Toy Burg"" supplier) and am ordering again from another supplier that I had previously used that represented the correct box (this one being ""The Candy Co."").

The Kashi brand would lead one to believe that it is, and the back of the box reads, "". . .just like homemade!"" I'd love to list the ingredients here, but I can not read the print on the box. It is tiny and printed in white on a yellow background. I had to go to the Kashi website to find a readable list.<br /><br />It's not all ""bad."" Kashi's signature ""seven whole grains and sesame"" are in these bars. Canola oil? Well, some say that's not good for you. I don't know, but I do know that it's doubtful that the very long list of ingredients would not be in any ""yummy banana bread. . .just like homemade!""<br /><br />The back of the box boasts that each bar contains 1/2 a daily serving of fruit, and 1/2 a daily serving of ""veggie"" (from pumpkin). These bars taste like cookies to me. I like them, but if one wants a cookie, there's plenty of cookies out there, and if one wants a healthy snack, an apple and a few pieces of broccoli would serve you far better than one of these. We fool ourselves when we eat products like this. They are not ""health food,"" even with the assurance that ""you can snack with satisfaction and feel good about it!"" from Kashi (on the side of the box). An honest cookie, one that contains flour, butter, and sugar, is just as good or bad for a person as these.",-0.52

I just never expected that from a mix. They were super easy to make too and I think they make exactly the right amount. They were all gone long before we got tired of them or before they could get stale.<br /><br />We don't like crispy cookies and I thought the batter was a little sticky (the stickier the batter, the crispier the cookie) so I chilled the dough just a bit and used my cookie scoop to make uniform cookies. I also used my insulated baking sheets and these turned out perfect!<br /><br />I experimented a little with these the second time I made them and added just a little flour and chilled the dough thoroughly. Then I rolled it out, cut it into circles and put a dollop of homemade raspberry jam in the center of a circle, topped with another circle of the dough (the second circle I cut a couple of small slits in prior to placing it on top), sealed the edges and baked that way, again on insulated baking sheets.

It has fresh fruits and vegetables (which are important in the diet as well- I give my puppy apple slices and carrots to snack and chew/teeth on).<br /><br />I alternate brands occasionally depending on how tight money is that month. Another brand that my puppy eats and really likes is the ""Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lovers Soul"" dry and canned. I feed the Chicken Soup for the Cat lovers soul to my cat all the time. That brand is high quality and about $12 for a 10 lb bag. Very reasonable.<br /><br />Good luck on your dog food choice.<br />try searching the site ""Dog Food Analysis"".<br />Great informational",0.98

Shop around.)<br /><br />I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert. Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores. I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun. We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor. It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce. In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like. (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor. Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue. As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.

51139,0,15.0,Male,3.0,0,22.0,1.0,4.0,127.66,Tasty,"Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.<br /><br />The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.<br /><br />The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.<br /><br />I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.<br /><br />The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.<br /><br />I like these a lot.

To preserve the original spicy flavor, the egg should be hard-boiled in the soup. But some prefers to blend the soft yolk to the soup for a milder taste. There are a lot of people who blend the whole egg to the soup during cooking, this makes it a wholly different kind. Note, as more egg blends into the soup, you are more inclined to finish the whole soup, which is not too great for your health (too much sodium).<br />2.

I have purchased it in the past for myself and as a gift for someone who says it is her favorite tea.<br /><br />That said the seller I tried to purchase from, ARRAM Traders, is a bit strange.  I placed an order, but the order remained listed as ""shipping soon"" with a wide range on the estimated arrival date. Since my purchase included a gift, I wasn't sure if shipment would arrive in time so I emailed ARRAM Traders and said I wanted to cancel and told them why. (I thought I would go online and try to track down another source.)<br /><br />Shipper contacted me saying they had already shipped. I replied that I had only cancelled<br />because shipping was vague, and so was happy that it might arrive soon afterall. Asked, if they had any estimate of arrival time. Afterall, UK delivers to US all the time and they should have some I idea based on previous deliveries to the States.<br /><br />ARRAM Traders said they couldn't tell me anything about a delivery estimate and chose to cancel the order.  Very strange.  I suspect that they were out of stock, had not actually shipped the tea at all and were not sure when they would ship, if ever.  Otherwise, they should have been able to tell me when they shipped and, based on other shipments made to US, estimate delivery (a week, two weeks....whatever).<br /><br />So if you like a brightly flavored tea and can find it, I recommend this one highly.

At even Whole Foods, I typically pay $1.69 per bar, and get a slight discount for buying an entire box. Once you add shipping to Amazon's prices, they are more expensive online. Also, keep in mind the season when ordering them. All of the coatings had melted and were stuck to the packaging, then fell off in pieces when opened, due to having melted during shipment. But if you can get them locally, give them a try. There are many flavors to choose from, though most stores seem to only carry a few.<br /><br />Those people who claim they are awful tasting probably haven't tried other protein bars that are low-carb and gluten-free, and expect them to taste like candy bars or high-sugar bars that may be more tasty, but are also full of ingredients that render them nutritionally useless.",0.92

51342,0,12.0,Male,2.0,0,15.0,1.0,7.0,199.91,"A perfect, natural sugar substitute","Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.<br /><br />* Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.<br /><br />* Contains virtually no calories.<br /><br />* Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.<br /><br />* Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.<br /><br />* Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.<br /><br />* Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />* Can be used in baking.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.<br /><br />* Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)<br /><br />* In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)<br /><br />* Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)<br /><br />* Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.<br /><br />Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.",0.58

A special feature of this product: It will NOT form black ""varnish"" inside or outside of your kettle - be it a commercial machine or a home version - it is a clean oil.  This oil is solid at room temperature, and you will need some sort of scoop (as an ice cream or cookie scoop) to measure it out of the container.

Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE.<br /><br />So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well.<br /><br />I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one.<br /><br />Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning.<br /><br />This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me!",-0.58

My boyfriend loves it too; I have to remind him I'm not a flower and he shouldn't go around sniffing me!<br /><br />I've also been using the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner for the last month & was immediately hooked. I decided to try the shampoo since my hair and nose seemed to agree with the conditioner so much.<br /><br />The shampoo, like the conditioner, has a sweet, floral smell. It's feminine & flirty and I immediately loved it. The texture is fairly thick but still a bit silky if you rub it between your fingers (this is important for me because I can't have shampoo that's too drying).<br /><br />My hair is fairly long, naturally curly, and thick. I wear it naturally (air-dried and curly) about twice a week so that it can recuperate, and flat iron it to death the rest of the time. I want my hair to be as shiny, soft, frizz-free, and generally healthy as possible either way I wear it, which is a tall order.<br /><br />In order to accomplish this I've developed an optimal routine over time & experimentation. I use a miniscule amount of shampoo ONLY on my scalp, & condition the bottom half of my hair BEFORE rising. This way, the shampoo is pulled through the strands & cleans them without overly-drying the bottom half.<br /><br />I MUST use a shampoo that is cleansing (so that the top of my head doesn't look oily), isn't drying to my scalp or hair, and smells nice. All of this has been accomplished so far with the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo. Note that a little goes a LONG way. If I use too much I notice that my hair won't be as silky & a bit on the dry side. However, it's all a matter of adjusting and figuring out what amount works for your hair.<br /><br />I 100% plan on continued usage of both the conditioner and now the shampoo. I'm crazy about the conditioner but I like the shampoo too. I'm so happy this new brand is on the market!",0.98

I remember going to the farms and sampling the product. As an adult, I have tried to buy high quality syrup from Canada and have been disappointed. Doing a little research, I found that Vermont is where all the unadulterated quality syrup is now sourced.<br /><br />I found grade B to be a little too dark if tasted on its own. It is, however, perfect in its richness, darkness, and maple flavor once it has been drizzled on your food of choice. It is like being a kid again!<br /><br />Packaging: I ordered one jug. It appeared to be pre-packed by the supplier, with the ""ready to ship"" sticker on the box. I imagine they did this due to the leaking others have experienced from time to time. Problem solved! The packaging was wall to wall insulated and the jug itself wrapped with bubble wrap. I can not vouch for other quantities, but a one jug order will be packaged very well.<br /><br />Health: I am a health nut, a trained chef, and a biomedical engineer. Not only is this good quality syrup, but maple syrup has been found recently to have a wide variety of healthy antioxidants. The amount of syrup needed per use is very small, due to the quality and intense flavor. The sugar content is partially and possibly totally made up for by the content of flavanoids usually found in citrus and the catechins found in green tea, tree bark, and chocolate. These help inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates to reduce blood glucose spikes. This is worlds better than drizzling corn syrup on your carbs which would increase the glucose load.

My cat's coat is so glossy, smooth and she rarely sheds. She LOVES this food. I can't free feed her because she will eat all of it! It also has seemed to help regulate her weight. She put on a few pounds after being spayed and now she's starting to look slim again. Her eyes are clear and her energy levels are through the rough. Seriously, give this food a try. I did after researching foods here on amazon and I won't switch to anything else. The only drawback is the price-$20 for a 13 lb bag, but I have just the one cat and this bag lasts a long, long time. I'm going to switch my dog over to Blue Buffalo-the company kindly helped me choose a diet through a series of emails. I can't afford (nor do I really want to fool with it) to feed my animals a raw food diet but this is probably the next best thing. I also feed my girls canned food from the ""Wilderness"" line as a treat---they go absolutely CRAZY over it, especially my cat. They don't give that same reaction with grocery store brands. Also, this is kinda gross, but she very rarely leaves a gross litter box smell while on this food.<br />Please if you love your pets and want them to be healthy, try this food!!",0.99

The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.

I usually make my own rubs.  I thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case I didn't feel like making a rub.<br /><br />Most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar.  This rub does not contain any sugar.  It is however very heavy on the salt.  I am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark.  I made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible.  I tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough.<br /><br />I have used this rub on other foods and had better results.  A little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where I use this in place of salt.<br /><br />If you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar.  I prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own.  I just wish they used more of the other ingrediantes and less salt as the spice is very tasty.<br /><br />If you plan on using this to spice up other foods in place of salt you may be very happy with this.,0.62

I like an oil that has some flavor (tasty flavor not gone-rancid flavor, of course) since to me that says it hasn't been processed into something unhealthy. This oil definitely fits that description and the flavor is reminiscent of chewing on a grape leaf (I heard grape leaves are really good for you - good to put in a green smoothie - so I was chewing one out in the garden.) Because of the flavor it doesn't go with everything. Wonderful for salad dressings, I like the flavor when cooking a veggie burger but it tasted really weird on a grilled sandwich I made.

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.

The first day, I introduced the cats to the Petite Cuisine seafood entr&eacute;es. The next evening, they got to try these two Entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the ""gravy"" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn't -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner.

It's like eating a pint of ice with one drop of flavor on it. I took about 10 bites and couldn't go on. It's been sitting in my freezer ever since.

We have tried everything from Eukanaba to Merrick to Innova, and Orijen has given us the best results.  Orijen has an excellent breeders program, in which if you are accepted you receive your 7th bag of food free.  This is a huge savings and brings the cost of Orijen down to near what most foods sold at PetCo or similar companies cost.  Also, we were hesitant to try Orijen or any grain free food for that matter because of all the claims of kidney issues.  Do your research, don't take my word for it, but protein is broken down in the liver, not the kidney -- claims that it causes kidney failure are grossly inaccurate.  Dogs with existing kidney issues may have a harder time excreting broken down protein, but that would affect all dog foods.  Remember, if your dog is sick, your vet puts the dog on chicken and rice or boiled hamburger and rice (these foods are rich in protein).<br /><br />Another interesting point is, we have bulldogs that we show.  These dogs are particularly, let's say, ""beefy"".  We were worried that this food would slim them down too much and make them not look like a show standard, but it did not.  2 cups/day is perfect for them.  Remember calories are not an exact science and your dog will not absorb every calorie from any dog food (thus why they poop), so don't be worried if you have to feed more or less of any particular food.<br /><br />Do your research, you won't find a better food, made with better ingredients than Orijen for anywhere close to this price.  EVO is much more massively produced, and its meat ingredients are purchased, not raised by the company like Orijens.  Never preserved, never frozen, fresh meat is what Orijen is about.",0.93

When I saw this offering and it claimed to be natural I became very interested.  From a packaging stand point, I love the way these little packets can be thrown in a glove compartment, purse, diaper bag or book bag.  They travel well and open easily.<br /><br />Upon opening the packet I would pour the powder into a standard water bottle (16.9 fl oz.) and shake very very vigorously.  I found that if the water was not ice cold and I did not continue to shake vigorously for a minute then there would be flavor crystal sediment on the bottom.  If the water was ice cold, the powder would incorporate well.  The color does stain, so that may be a concern for some.  Now for the flavor aspect...  Personally this Iced Green Tea mix is just too sweet and artificial flavored.  From the first sip I was assaulted by a cloyingly sweet and rather sickening flavor.  I resorted to sort of holding my breath and guzzling down.  When it came to the last quarter of the bottle I would always dump it; just too sweet.  For me, it tasted very much like what I remember red Kool-Aid tasting like when I was young.  I personally don't allow my children to drink red Kool-Aid.  They loved this stuff!  A bit too enthusiastically for my liking.  They would fight over the bottle, which was just plain odd.  Two days passed and when I returned to the cabinet I had discovered that the kids has been sneaking the packets and polished off the whole box.  My husband on the other hand, hated it and he loves sweet drinks.  He didn't like the sweet 'fake' aftertaste (his words).<br /><br />If you like very very sweet tasting drinks and prefer when drinks have that fake 'aspartame' taste then this should be a winner for you.  Our kids aged 9, 8 and 5.5 loved it.  They found it easy enough to mix on their own apparently.  I just wish that the product was a bit more natural and less 'diet'.<br /><br />Recommend only if you fit the the profile of a customer that would enjoy it.  If you love Kool-Aid mixed with way too many portions then you might just enjoy this.  Kudos on the packaging, which is very much like Crystal Light... thumbs down on a very kiddie oriented flavor profile.  Blackberry pomegranate sounds very adult... Kool-Aid not so much.",0.97

She only descends to the dungeon once a week to do laundry asserting I have rendered the place otherwise uninhabitable yet now she has no qualms about daily covert excursions to embargo my stash.<br /><br />Despite my high hopes, Vitamin Squeeze can only serve as a red herring for my personal nutrition inspector Javert because although it is minimally acceptable for quick hydration, it will not compel me to skip the beverage aisle to replenish my cache of Hawaiian punch, Pepsi and orange crush (Okay,  some peppery V8, orange and apple juice as well but they detract from my riff). The product seems convenient and reasonably easy to use although determining consistent squeeze pressure to accommodate my taste preferences in 8 oz. of water is a challenge.<br /><br />My first attempt resulted in four times the suggested amount so I guess me and the product manufacturer have widely disparate perceptions of general squeeze pressure. That rate would result in merely six glasses per container. Only afterwards did I notice the striations on the side of the bottle which approximate the recommended squeeze amount of ½ oz. per 8 oz. glass, so long as the bottle's solution level is visually discernible with offset illumination.<br /><br />But, I guess I am consistent since I didn't notice the perforations around the cap wrapping until I had stabbed it with a steak knife either. Once the tabbed safety seal is removed, also be sure to replace the cardboard washer correctly or it is quite likely you will end up with a syrupy fruit punch stain wherever the inverted bottle is to be stored.<br /><br />Even so, I wasn't enthusiastic about the sweetness or aftertaste with the suggested application - or my prodigious proportion - as in each instance a metallic aftertaste was evident, in the case of the reduced amount simply in what looked like watered down Hawaiian punch. That said, in either case it is a vast improvement over the saltiness of Gatorade.<br /><br />On the positive side at that rate using it up within 30 days shouldn't be a problem, in fact using it up in a couple of exercise sessions is nearly guaranteed. Since the container appeared so portable and the enhancer is obviously much more soluble than a powdery type addictive, one of my brilliant ideas was to keep a container in my car since I tend consume a lot of appreciably less healthy fluids while driving between business sites but the instructions also suggest refrigeration after opening so how that will work out is yet to be determined.",-0.52

51696,0,15.0,Male,3.0,1,11.0,1.0,0.0,126.96,From a skeptic: this stuff WORKS!,"A coworker shared her Braggs ACV one day at work when I came in terribly hungover (I swear this is not a common occurance, but hey,I'm only human), to help flush my system. I can't say that it was a miracle hangover cure, because really nothing is and if someone knows of one message me will ya, but it sparked my interest in this natural remedy. I bought my own bottle and began drinking 1 to 2 tablespoons diluted with water before bed. I didn't expect to see any miracles occur, or even to notice a difference in how I felt, and at first I didn't. However, after a few weeks it dawned on me that I had not felt tired at all throughout the day. Nope, no usual after lunch, lethargic, I need a GD siesta feeling! It also dawned on me that everyone in my family had been sick, not to mention salon clients who pumped themselves full of cold medicine to come get their roots touched up, as they all but sneezed in my mouth while getting their bangs trimmed. I mean really? While I'm mixing your color you want me to mix your Theraflu too? Stay home!!! Sorry, that sneezing thing is gross but a reality, and guess who defied the odds and did NOT get sick? Me!(I figured you got that but just in case). And on top of that, and maybe the best difference I noticed, is that I slept like a freakin' baby. I had grown accustomed to waking up 1 to 2 nights a week and not being able to fall back asleep for four or so hours. I would toss, turn, my mind would race, then I would flip on the tv and watch 6 syndicated episodes of Roseanne in a row at 3 in the morning. Now as much as people are impressed that you can name all 6 of Aunt Jackie's professions in chronological order, they are even more impressed when you don't nod off in your car while at a four way stop. I'm telling you I got the most restful and peaceful sleep I have had in years. Like that deep NyQuil sleep, except you're sober when your alarm goes off in the morning. So I have continued the ACV regimen for months now, and if I wasn't convinced before, a couple weeks ago I didn't take it for 5 days and guess what happened? Yep, daytime tiredness, moody as can be, and insomnia for the first time since I discovered this wonderful rotten battery acid tasting magic that is so so good for you. Now, this expiriment is by no means scientifically sound and there are, of course, some uncontrolled variables that come into play. But from this skeptic's point of view, this stuff is the jam. I just know it works. And as for the afformentioned unpleasant flavor? I plug my nose while I chug it and pretend its lemonade. Doing this completely blocks the flavor and you just have the acidic mouthfeel. Those who tell you the flavor is good or just to add a little honey and its good or whatever, are lying. They will probably also tell you that they LOVE the taste of quinoa and that apple sauce makes the perfect substitute for butter in your baked goods. Okay so takeaway, get yourself some Braggs and get on the road to better energy, immunity, and quality, sound sleep (I probably could have just said that right off the bat and spared your the rest, huh? Sorry.)",0.56

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",0.45

We were giving him laxatone and lactulose 2x a day. When he recently had a severe bout of diarrhea and a possible UTI, the vet prescribed Hills Science diet c/d. What a crock that stuff is! I did my own research (and I encourage you to do the same) and found that cats should get their water from their food. The Wellness canned food I feed my cats now has 78% water. After feeding them Wellness for three weeks, little Gary is off the meds he's been taking for three years, and our other cat Sugar has lost weight and is much more active. Neither of them drink hardly any water from their bowls anymore, which scared me a little at first, but is apparently normal and good. Gary has only had a few problems since the switch.

A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.",0.44

Granted, some of this tartness comes from the other juices used in its creation, including but not necessarily limited to lemon and white grape.  Nonetheless, the flavor profile is all apple, and what's left (to borrow Izze's own tag line) is a ""naturally delightful"" and wholly refreshing vitamin-enriched (C, B6, and Niacin) beverage, delivered in a 8.4 fluid ounce slim can.<br /><br />We were impressed enough with the apple, that we went out and picked up bottles of blueberry, clementine, and peach.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice.

On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.<br /><br />I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newman's Own brand - but i'll never buy their products again.

I was trying to replace other types of dry chicken tender-type treats (Waggon Train), which it turns out were made in China, and I found these, which I verified are Made in the USA.  The only part of this product that is imported are the nutrients, according to the company, but the chicken is from the US and the Lamb is from New Zealand.  The company can't source the nutrients (vitamins) in the the quantity needed here, so they import them and test them, but the product is then manufactured here in the US.<br /><br />The representative on the phone told me that most of their treats are made in the US, a couple are manufactured in Canada, and that one treat she thought was manufactured in Columbia.  I asked why the label on the product just says distributed by Nestle Purina Petcare company in St. Louis, MO, and that the label doesn't say manufactured or ""Made in the USA,"" and she stated that the FDA doesn't require that a label state ""Made in the USA,"" if it is made here.  The FDA requires that if a product is made in another country, that the name of that country be stated.  I told her it would probably help the company, and consumers, if they would actually state ""Made in the USA"" on the label.<br /><br />At any rate, my dogs love these.  I have subscribed for delivery on this product, which lowers the price a bit, and also saves me the time and money of having to go to Petsmart to purchase them.  That way, I always have them in the house.  I go through about a bag every two weeks for my two dogs, a Sheltie and a Chihuahua.  Hope this info helps you! Thanks!",0.78

But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.

So far we have been very happy with the end result. Our coffee is frothy, foamy and delicious. We don't like super strong espresso-type coffee but love the convenience of grinding and brewing one cup at a time. We've figured out how to adjust the grind so the flavor is not so strong. This method of brewing one cup at a time is so much more environmentally-correct than the pod-type coffee makers. What the heck do you do with all those leftover plastic pods? This machine grinds the beans, compresses them and then forces the water through the compressed puck of ground coffee. Great taste and then just throw out the coffee puck. There is a bit of labor intensive cleaning, however. It needs to be kept free from clogs and oily build-up. It comes apart and cleans easily so it hasn't been a problem.

My cat refused to eat the Purina NF and Hills K/D sold at my vet's office and was willing to starve himself if that was all he was offered. I read many reviews on other sites prior to purchasing and located a site where you can order individual cans. Great as a trial in case my cat refused to eat it. However, that site sent me 6 cans of the old formula and 6 cans of the new formula.  Being new to this brand, I turned to the internet to figure out what had changed. Apparently, the ingredient listings have not been updated for the new formula, even on the manufacter's site.  The new formula lists beef as the primary meat ingredient.<br /><br />My two cats including one that does not have kidney problems were initially enjoying the food, licking their plates clean with a distinct preference towards what turned out to be the old formula. I thought finally I had found a kidney diet that wouldn't end up in the trash. By the time I received the shipment, the attraction had worn off. One of my cats vigorously claws at the floor in an attempt to cover the food dish and the other (diagnosed with kidney disease) runs from the bowl after a few bites. They have gone back to eating regular food for now.  However, I am going to try and mix the more enticing food into the Hi-Tor before I completely give up on it and request a refund, and continue my search.

It is very sweet when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  If you like sweetness, this one is for you.  This may be a good syrup to use if you want to put in less syrup in your Master Cleanse lemonades in order to cut calories.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU"">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.

Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980"">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.

51870,0,7.0,Female,2.0,0,14.0,7.0,7.0,186.21,High fiber isn't necessarily a good thing!,"I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

When I found out that Sunspire makes these dark chocolate almond butter cups, I was so very tempted to buy the 24-pack.  I refrained, though, because I wasn't sure it was worth paying $40 for a large package of edible items I had never even tried.  Instead, I happened to come across individual packages at the local food co-op, and was extremely jazzed to give them a try.  Unfortunately, they left me a little disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, the dark chocolate was really delicious, but that was about all I could taste.  There was hardly any almond butter within the cup itself, and that was what I was really excited about.  I would estimate that by volume, the cup is 80% chocolate and 20% almond butter.  So, in the end, it's not your Reese's-caliber cup, with a light covering of chocolate on the outside and a generous helping of nut butter on the inside, but it will definitely satisfy a sweet-tooth in a pinch, and the product appears less processed and even a bit healthier than the more popular alternatives.

The cereal is similar in taste and shape to Cap'n Crunch, but the pieces are smaller and more wholesome (made with Kashi's 7 Whole Grains).<br /><br />My general criteria for cereal is that it should have a reasonable amount of fiber and less than 10g of sugar. This particular cereal has an even fiber/sugar ratio (6g each) so you know it is healthy.

I buy the capsule version of the Pill Pockets versus the tablet version because the bags are larger (it holds more ounces) and the cost difference is almost nothing. I then break that one capsule up into many pieces because they are soft & malleable. I am able to get that one bag to last me for many servings. I only use it to wrap up my dog's Prozac pill.  He will gobble it down with no problem. However, if I try to use any larger pill such as a Heartworm pill or Allergy pill in them, he will eat the treat part off & spit out the medicinal pill.

I prefer a truly dry ginger ale, which is pretty hard to find.

Unfortunately, while the dryness is there, and is pleasant, it's overpowered by a flavor which I can't quite figure out.  I can only describe it as 'musty', and it may have something to do with the 'hint of oak' referred to on the bottle's label. It's apparent from the first sip, and is quick to emerge and re-emerge.  Whatever it is, it overwhelms everything that is good about this ale.  It's too bad, because with it's dryness and sharp carbonation, this could be a really good brew.",0.72

They are tender and juicy when grilled, I will say that...but you'll be through eating one in less than 2 minutes. There's no difference between Omahas chicken breasts and regular chicken breasts I can buy in any grocery store Save a lot/Aldi included....for well over 1/2 the price of what they charge for these and for nearly quadruple the amount. So, why charge so much for these? I can get behind their steaks, even though they're overpriced too, and a few other Omaha products like the hot dogs and stuffed baked potatoes, but can't really get behind these chicken breasts. It's not like these are organic chicken breasts that have a decent size to them, which is what the price Omaha charges for them would suggest. These are as generic as generic gets. Would of been fine if 1 of their chicken breasts was the size of 2 of their chicken breasts. Instead it's like they got 1 large chicken breast and cut it it up to make 4 out of it. Luckily, I received these in a comped sampler. There's no reason whatsoever for anyone to buy just these chicken breasts through Omaha Steaks as Omaha gives you no reason to. Omaha really needs to make their portions bigger. People would be fine paying their prices if the portions were bigger...but half the things they sell the price to size ratio leaves you feeling ripped off. Not that I paid for these as like I said they were comped, but if I did no doubt I'd feel pretty ripped off. Change your mentality Omaha. Instead of less is more, think MORE is MORE.

Despite my hair feeling okay after using these products, I won't be giving up my usual products.

It's not that they don't smell good; they smell okay. Not my favorite scent, but it's fine. The issue is more that I don't feel like the scent stays with my hair.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the professionalism of the company, particularly given how much my relative invested in what was truly a thoughtful and unique gift. The company does not provide either nutrition information or, perhaps more importantly, a list of ingredients, for most of their desserts. This can pose a serious risk to individuals with any food allergy.  Upon requesting such information,  I was simply told, and I quote: ""We choose not to disclose our vendor's information to keep our clubs exclusive and a continuous surprise for our members."" Of the six months of dessert we received, three desserts arrived with issues. We received a mango tart in dry ice that had clearly melted/evaporated. Since I didn't have the list of ingredients, nor any knowledge of how long it had been sitting ""unrefrigerated,"" I had to throw the entire tart out. We received a cheese cake in the same state.  Cookies were shipped, one month, and upon receipt they were dry, and every one was broken and crumbling. This is not to say that every dessert was bad. We got two months of brownies (which were superb) and one month of a coffee cake (which did come with nutrition info/ingredients).  Dessert products aside, the shipments were always on time. While the company offers a wide variety of other clubs to try, given my experience with the Dessert of the Month club, I would be very hesitant to try any of the other options.",-0.85

How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat's reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br />""Meowwwww! Errowwww!"" (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I'll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.  The noted finickiness of cats usually applies to dry food.  Place a bowl of any random dead animal parts in front of them and they are far more decisive.

After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).

(I purchased it for a dog who was very thin and needed to gain weight.)<br /><br />The ingredient list of this food sounds great-- no corn or other indigestible grains, and lots of great healthy vegetables, fruits, and carbs in addition to high quality meats and probiotics. There are NO yucky ""meat by-products""-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about. Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs). The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn't feel full/stays hungry).<br /><br />If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product. If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog's weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal. I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn't mean the same foods are ideal for each dog.<br /><br />You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs.. (there's also a fish/sweet potato version) or Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag)) (there are several great Wellness varieties) or Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs. (there are several varieties of Nutro Ultra, too). These foods have the same high quality human grade ingredients, but appear to have a little bit lower protein and fat profiles.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a list of the major ingredients/nutritional profile-- check it out, talk it over with your vet, and make up your own mind about whether or not this is a good choice for your best pal.<br /><br />Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal, egg product, sweat potatoes, peas, potatoes, canola oil, roasted bison, roasted venison, natural flavor, tomato pomace, ocean fish meal, choline chloride, dried chicory root, tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, yucca schidigera extract, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, and the expected added vitamins.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Wondering if your dog is overweight? An easy way to tell is to look down at your dog while it is standing. Viewed from overhead, you should see a definite ""waist"" narrowing in front of the back legs. Another easy test is to feel the dog's ribs. You should be able to easily feel slight dips between the ribs-- if you can't they are covered with a layer of fat (of course, prominent ribs mean your dog is too thin).",0.82

He was diagnosed 10 years ago and I was diagnosed a little over a month ago.<br /><br />When I made this pudding mix with skim milk, it spiked my husband's blood sugar so for a long time, we haven't had it. My husband has quite the sweet tooth and since he is very active and a normal weight, I decided to try making it with heavy cream instead. Skim milk has approximately 11.9 grams of carbs per cup and you need 2 cups to make this recipe. That's just too many carbs for us. Plus I know my husband and there's just no way he's going to limit himself to a half cup serving.<br /><br />The heavy cream I buy has no carbs. Instead of 2 cups of milk I replace it with half heavy whipping cream and half water and cook as directed on the package. It sets up just fine. My husband loves it and even when he eats half of it at a time, it doesn't spike his blood sugar. It hasn't affected his weight or his cholesterol levels either. I make it about twice a week or so.<br /><br />The downside: Adding heavy cream adds LOTS of calories to this pudding so if you are someone who has to watch fat/calories then this wouldn't work for you.

Babies are amazing at how expressive they are when they don't want food offered to them.<br /><br />My ten month old twins eat these crackers, but not every time they're offered, and they're fairly healthy with the possible exception of saltiness.  They're by far the saltiest thing they eat.<br /><br />Considering that they need to put things in their mouths due to teething and basic discovery of the world, this is a great product to have on hand just to give them something edible that can go in the mouth.<br /><br />Getting it in a pack of 6 at this discount beats buying them one box at a time at the store.  I haven't seen this in a big box store yet, so I believe this must be one of the better deals at the moment.<br /><br />One box of these for babies around the age of mine (10 months) will last a long time.

We go through LOTS of garlic at home, to the point where we'd be buying at least six large heads of garlic every week.  Super, I thought, three pounds of garlic delivered so I'll be stocked all the time!  The price for the size of the bag was very good, I thought.<br /><br />When I received the garlic, however, I was very disappointed in the quality.  I began using the garlic the very night I received it, so it was not sitting in my pantry for months.  Here is what I found:  Fully half the bag was either rotten, shriveled, or sprouting.  This is indicative of garlic that has been sitting around for some time and/or improperly stored.  When stored properly, fresh garlic remains fresh, firm, and crisp for weeks... or months.  Many of the heads in the bag were completely rotten all the way through.  Some were just light for their size and the cloves were wrinkled and shriveled.  An equal number were in an advanced stage of sprouting.  Those that were suitable for use were OK, but only just that.  These were not fresh heads of garlic.<br /><br />Very disappointed, I contacted Casa de Fruta via email.  After my second message, they were kind enough to ship a brand new bag immediately.  To their credit, the new bag of garlic arrived very quickly.  It was definitely better than the first, but I still lost about 10 heads of garlic to rot and shriveling; that's still a lot in a 3 pound bag, and what would have been a great deal for a full bag of fresh, crisp garlic turned out to be just a real disappointment and a bad deal for a bag of average-to-poor-to-unusable garlic.  For reference, I went through the entire second bag in less than a month, and it was stored in a cool, dry environment.  It was stored properly, in other words.<br /><br />So, at this point I don't know what to think.  I based my original purchase on the few - and all excellent - reviews and, indeed, I would have rated the garlic at 4 stars + had the second bag contained what I was expecting from the reviews.  That was not my experience, however.  It is possible, I suppose, that I was just twice unlucky.  Still, you'd think that the company would have made certain that the second bag sent, DUE to a customer complaint of quality no less, would have been totally primo.  I've got to go with the odds on this one then, and take my garlic business elsewhere.<br /><br />One final note:  Had it not been for courteous and timely response from the vendor, I would have rated this product at one star rather than two based on the quality.",0.42

It might taste good to some, but not me. I've so far had one other brand on amazon, and a few brands in store, and I disliked this one.<br /><br />The snack bites have a few problems.<br /><br />1) They're fairly watery. Not only do they look more ""reconstituted"" than other brands, but their water content seems higher.<br /><br />2) they're lacking flavor.<br /><br />I try to solve problem one and two, by cutting them in half, dosing them in some hotsauce pepper mix, and drying them in the sun [and once in the oven]. This is rather time consuming, sort of. But even then, the oil/protein ratio is higher (meaning more oil) it seems than other turkey snacks.  Which is lame.<br /><br />So, I'll keep looking for good turkey jerky on amazon [which is basically anywhere, since beef is the game in most stores], any suggestions in the comments I'd appreciate. Preferably at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />P.S, of humerus note, I noticed one of the suggested tags are ""Hip Hop"".

52236,0,27.0,Female,2.0,0,17.0,1.0,4.0,205.02,"High quality product I rely upon..thank you, Purina!","I must agree with the first reviewer, as I've never once seen any feline of any age show anything less than enthusiasm for Purina Kitten Chow. I purchase at least one on these seven pound bags per month, although my youngest are now approaching one year of age. Many people (myself included) avoid commercial cat foods, but I've had some truly great results with Kitten Chow over the years.<br /><br />I don't think of Kitten Chow as ""for kittens only"". No doubt there are people who will disagree, but I've observed the benefits of feeding to older cats or kittens who are either malnourished, recuperating from a surgical procedure or are outdoor, feral cats who refuse to allow humans to touch them. This is what I bought and fed a young female cat who arrived on my front porch last winter, cold, starving and frightened..and, as I realized about a month later, when she'd gained weight and bone mass, very pregnant. Initially, I hadn't expected this cat to survive, but she thrived.<br /><br />Then I feared that if she succeeded in giving birth to a litter, her kittens might be weak and have a less than optimal chance for growing to adulthood. Wrong again! She got through the birth like a champion and each of her four kittens are healthy and happy (all, including the Mom cat have been spayed or neutered). Her diet and then theirs, until they were weaned: Purina Kitten Chow, a Cat Mother's Milk supplement and chicken or turkey (human) baby food. The Kitten Chow remains as part of their regular diet.<br /><br />The feral outdoor cats benefit from the extra nutrients and fat content. I often wonder how these poor critters survive sub-freezing temperatures and have built a few small shelters to keep them out of the wind, rain and snow that I've no evidence they use (back to the shelter drawing board for me!), but Purina Kitten Chow is food they adore and eat and I'm convinced it has helped these cats survive (and one I was able to humanely trap and have neutered and vaccinated before releasing him back outdoors ~ his definite preference ~ survived the surgery and the winter cold, an attack by another feral and territorial cat and now appears quite healthy).<br /><br />I could be a snob about this as so many people seem to be: if a product is commercial, it isn't trustworthy or truly good..but I've seen a lot of recalls of very expensive high-end guaranteed organic kitten and cat foods and Purina Kitten Chow did not seem to make it to the recall list. When I believe a feline needs even more nutrition than this food provides (a RARE occurrence), I typically resort to DIY recipes where there is no issue with Quality Assurance.<br /><br />Honestly, this food is not only a favorite with cats of all ages, but I believe it is also a lifesaver. It's great that Amazon has made this product available, as it saves me a 50+ mile trip into town and a lot of running around miles of a ""Super store"" to be able to receive it via USPS at regular intervals. Now that these kittens are *technically* cats, it might seem less than optimal to feed them Kitten Chow. Still, I continue to incorporate it into their diet. The only reason I could imagine NOT to make this food available to your kitten or cat is if they appeared to be overweight..and mine (who live entirely indoors) aren't. They're in terrific shape! They all have exquisitely beautiful and healthy coats, lovely clear eyes & zero GI problems. They prefer the Kitten Chow to Purina's ""All Ages"" Original Formula and if you feel any concerns you can always mix a percentage of both together as an extra incentive ~ and those of you for whom price is no object: it's good to keep a bag around when your cat refuses to eat the high end Prescription Diet.<br /><br />Again, this is the food of choice IMO for feeding feral outdoor cats..particularly when you cannot afford to buy the really high end food that isn't necessarily any better (and is potentially far worse). In case you're concerned about longetivity: I've had a cat who lived to be nearly twenty years old who was entirely a Purina Kitten and Cat Chow cat who was healthy right to the end of his considerably long (indoor/outdoor..before I had the wisdom to learn that keeping one's cats indoors 24/7 was the kindest, safest way to go) life.",0.65

This candy was originally a children's favorite because it was a penny candy, it was one of the first individually wrapped candies, and it was durable under a variety of conditions, like being in a child's pocket.<br /><br />Leo Hirshfield first produced Tootsie Rolls in 1896.  Hirshfield named the candy after his five-year-old daughter, whose nickname was Tootsie.  Tootsie Rolls became even more popular as the United States emerged from the Great Depression.  Tootsie Rolls went to war in World War II as a part of soldiers' rations, and it became a G.I.'s favorite for the same reason it was a children's favorite; it was wrapped and durable under a variety of conditions.  The candy also provided a quick energy boost.<br /><br />Tootsie Rolls are chewy and have a mild chocolate flavor with modest sweetness.  While Tootsie Rolls get harder when cold, they become soft again when warmed, yet they never get so soft in normal circumstances that they actually melt.  However, in a child's pocket they can get very soft.<br /><br />Tootsie Roll Industries is now a candy giant, and yet the original candy retains all its charm and is very much like the original made by Leo Hirshfield.  Tootsie Rolls has now expanded to numerous other countries, and yet in many ways this popular candy is an American institution.<br /><br />For a flavor experience I also recommend assorted Tootsie Rolls, which has included lemon, vanilla and cherry.",0.48

That's 1/5 the weight of Dunkin' Donuts, Newman's Own, Millstone and 1/6 the weight of Starbucks.  This is the second time I've ordered coffee from Amazon and found it to be lacking.  Since they won't take returns, (even from prime members) I don't think I'll order any more coffee from Amazon in the future.  The reason I titled this review the second worst coffee was because I got tricked into buying a coffee that was really just instant coffee in a k-cup cartridge.  On second thought that actually was better than this.",0.72

Many times he walks away rather than eat something he does not care for.  Upon seeing Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food in his bowl he took the time to fully investigate by sniffing and lightly tasting with his tongue and then drooling (Shep has a tendency to do that when he really likes something).  Then, he started eating and he ate and he ate, until it was all gone.  Then, like one of the three bears he examed his empty bowl numerous times in the hopes that more would appear.  He repeated this ritual with every meal until the bag was gone.  We're on our way to the store now to refill his pleasure palate.  I can highly recommend this dog food.",-0.8

My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.

Basically looking for both, relaxation and soothing my digestive. I have used Yogi teas for ages now! They should be in my medicine cabinet rather than my pantry. I've used Yogi Kava Kava Stress Relief and Bedtime - both are strong and will sleep you or make you really mellow unable to be social. I only take them when I am about to panic and trust me, they will ease you... to sleep lol.  Calming and Relaxed Mind tea are good and more for taste and a light relaxation. Eh, can't complain. But this one, THIS ONE has it all. Definitely for the mind (chamomile and lavender) and body (lemon balm, lemongrass, etc and of course the MINT). Don't need to take two teas. This will sooth my nerves, NOT drowse me, calm any digestive disorder that might be present.<br /><br />Taste: Definitely the lavender comes in first but not overpowering like Relaxed Mind. Mellowed by the chamomile, mint with the ""tail"" being the honey? Not sweet though just sorta smells like honey. (Shhh! probably honeybush but they didn't include it lol :X) Red tinted due to rooibos. Has that earthy-ness of rooibos too. Very beautiful tea. The combination dances well with one another, and we are talking about strong herbs here. Good job Yogi! Lately, Yogi's been coming up with awesome new teas. Must be a new tea chef!<br /><br />I am buying two of these at a time till they go 6 pack and then I'll stock up. I am drinking this every single day and am scare to run out. For this price?

52324,0,13.0,Female,2.0,0,20.0,11.0,8.0,163.77,"Off-color, Irreverent  Hilarity","I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",0.71

You can actually pick these candies up at the Dollar Tree.<br /><br />But caution:<br />It's citric acid. Any type of acid burns, the sour you taste is not really a taste... as crazy as it seems, it's really a feeling in your tongue. Yes it's a good amount of citric acid in one piece, but you're not supposed to eat multiple pieces in a short period of time. You will actually burn a layer of skin-like-material on your tongue. Too much consumption can cause the tongue to bleed. It will heal quickly, as long as you don't eat more in the process of healing. It is true your tongue will actually shed flakes like sun burn. I know it's disgusting but it's how the body heals naturally. Hope this information helped you, or any else it may concern. (Mostly your tongues)",0.4

I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen).

52419,0,1.0,Male,3.0,0,14.0,1.0,7.0,165.49,Soooo tasty!,"Admittedly, I am a bit skeptical about gluten-free products. Most pale in comparison to the 'real' version they are trying to mimic. While this cookie mix probably couldn't go head-to-head with 'real' cookies per most peoples' standards, it certainly does for me. The mix is fool-proof and easy enough for children to make--you don't need an electric mixer at all--just mix by hand. You can add extra goodies too, though they are already very generous with the chocolate chunks. Walnuts or your favorite nut or fruit makes awesome additions.<br /><br />As for flavor, these guys are -tasty-. I really like the cocoa in the mix and although there's actually not a whole lot of sugar in them (6 g of sugar per cookie is -nothing- compared to other mixes and premade cookies), the cookies are very sweet. I've made, and served, them to regular cookie eaters (who are not gluten-free) and everyone has loved them.<br /><br />You can make these cookies more interesting by substituting coconut oil (which is full of 'good' fat and MCTs) for the butter. Do so at your discretion though---I love the taste (especially when combined with macadamia nuts), but it is certainly a subjective area. Also, as a warning, the cookies come out pretty crumbly if baked for the time specified on the packaging. I did not cook mine for the entire time suggested and remove them from the pan shortly after removing them from the oven. This has prevented any sticking and crumbling issue.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this mix and hope everyone who can't eat 'normal' cookies enjoys it too!",0.51

By about 1960, Constant Comment was sold as bulk tea, in a tea tin, at Jitney Jungle at I-44 & Peoria in Tulsa.  I've still got one of the tins!  My mother used to send me to the store.  She'd brew the bulk tea in a tea caddie and have a glass of iced tea at hand all day long.  I'd come in from playing and drink about half of her glass.  (Half was the most I could get away with without scolding.)  So I grew up drinking this.  (Never learned to like American coffee.)  We've traveled all over and have tried many fine teas, but this is our all-time favorite.  Both Bigelow and Twinnings have many good teas, but nothing is quite as good as Constant Comment!  ;^)<br /><br />Now Constant Comment comes in bags in individual foil pouches.  This has at least two advantages:  the foil preserves freshness and allows one to carry his tea with him to work or school to brew fresh!  The best way to brew Constant Comment is in an Iced Tea Pot.  We have two Iced Tea Pots from about 1998.  Just put two teabags in the holder at the top of the pot, fill with water and turn on.  When the first container of water is done, refill and you'll have two quarts of strong tea from two bags!  When brewed this way, the tea has no bitterness at all, so you don't even need lemon to adjust the bitterness!<br /><br />The best way to sweeten tea is with local honey.  Local honey will also tend to prevent allergic reactions to the local pollen and allieviate any hay fever that you may be experiencing.  But be sure to get at least a quart of honey and put about 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls in a quart of tea!  Enjoy!",0.71

I don't have to pass round the laxative anymore (a common reality of switching to the GF diet.)<br /><br />Make some pancakes (2 cups of the flour mix, 1 tsp baking soda, an egg, 1/4 cup oil, and 1/2 tsp xantham gum--thin with water or milk to desired consistency)and ease yourself into it with butter and syrup.

The K-Cup format makes the trek much easier and enjoyable with the guarantee of a fresh tasting cup every time, as opposed to coffee beans that can go stall plus the convenience of drinking something different with each single cup if I desire.<br /><br />The journey brought me to San Francisco Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser.  Having had the opportunity to travel I had experienced the the brand and was excited to see it ""available soon"" in K-Cups so I didn't hesitate to preorder.<br /><br />As I have come to rely on, Amazon delivered on time and I was anxious to try it the next morning.<br /><br />The Coffee (5 Stars)<br /><br />- Fog Chaser didn't fail to impress. In fact I would say it over delivered on quality based on my expectations - The rich full bodied taste and smooth finish made an excellent addition to my morning routine and I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />The Packaging (2 Stars)<br /><br />-  The K-Cupish like packaging, though innovative leaves room for improvement.  Instead of the traditional solid sealed K-Cup we have all grown use to the San Francisco Bay Coffee comes in a hybrid type packaging.  The coffee is held in a coffee filter material pouch that is attached to a K-Cup like top. It doesn't effect how you us it but it does effect a few other things.<br /><br />First off I seem to get more coffee grounds in my cup than I do with a traditional K-Cup.<br /><br />In addition the individual cups, because the coffee is exposed to air via the filter pouch freshness becomes an issue.  They come in the box sealed in an air tight bag but it is not resealable so once you open it the remaining coffee is exposed.  If this was the only coffee I drank it would probably not be an issue but because I jump around a lot it sits longer effecting the taste.  I guess I could place them in a resealable bag but call me lazy or cheap but I don't and feel I shouldn't have to.<br /><br />Lastly, though very nit-picky the individual cups will not sit in the coffee carousel I have on the counter next to the maker (you probably wouldn't want them to because of the freshness issue) but again it just makes it a little more inconvenient.<br /><br />As I drag myself into the kitchen after loosing the battle with my alarm clocks snooze button and I struggle in to make the first cup to get the caffeine flowing through my system I just don't like to work that hard at it.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />- The packaging itself will probably not keep me from reordering but it will be much less often than I would normally with some of my other favorites.<br /><br />So with all that said, if the packaging doesn't bother you or effect long term freshness, you are in for a very nice cup of coffee.",0.98

She has been eyeing our food and watching us intensely when we are eating. When she started trying to grab food off our plates, we knew she was ready to start eating.<br /><br />We skipped cereal all together and this was the second food that she tried after squash. I tasted a bit before giving it to her because I was curious about how strongly she would be able to taste the broccoli and spinach through the pear. While you can taste the greens, the pear mellows the flavor just enough. It isn't so sweet from the pear that baby will get used to sweet flavors though.<br /><br />The texture is perfect for her at this stage too. It isn't so thick that she has trouble with it but gives her more texture than something thinned out a lot with formula.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not crazy about the pouches. They don't stand up easily on my pantry shelves and I worry that they could be damaged or leak if I were carrying them around in a diaper bag. I do like that the cap goes back on since one pouch says it is two servings. Unfortunately, the packaging also makes it difficult to know when you have squeezed half of the food into the bowl.<br /><br />I think this is also pretty expensive. We purchased another organic baby food product in a similar pouch today that was less expensive, even before the coupon, and offered similar flavor choices.<br /><br />So my overall rating would be 5 stars for the taste and that it is made with organic ingredients but 3 stars for packaging and price.",0.6

52530,0,27.0,Female,3.0,0,25.0,4.0,7.0,274.26,S O O O O O......G O O D...! ! ! ! !,"When I was little, I coined a word for things that tasted SO good, just about nothing else could compare.  The word is: ""scrumptuutious"", (pronounced ""scrump-TOO-shus"", or ""scrump-TOO-tee-us"", if you prefer an English pronounciation....  Very, very few foods qualify for this appelation --but ""ROBINSON'S APPLE & BLACKCURRANT -- also known as ""Fruit Squash"" -- qualifies with a capital ""Q""!<br /><br />If you buy this delicious drink, my first suggestion is that you remove the labels, as much as is possible, from the tall, elegant plastic bottles. (This was not too difficult at all, at least for me, as the bottles I received had their labels very, very lightly attached to begin with.)  Then take the bottle(s), and put them in the refrigerator, and have the refrigerator's light shine through the bottle(s).  The dark-red liquid inside is so extraordinary, that you may see a beautiful, optical illusion: It may seem as if the slim, elegant bottle(s) is (or are), suddenly filled with the most equisitely beautiful and costly ruby....shaped just like the bottle(s)!  Or, if you wish, a non-alcholic beverage that looks exactly like the finest of fine red wine!  Of course, this is really just the pure, transparent concentrate inside, lit up and lit through, by your refrigerator's light....but it really is something quite wonderful, and quite beautiful, to see!<br /><br />I suggest you do this JUST after having received your bottles.  For this way, they are unopened, and you get to see the whole bottle lit up.  However, once the bottle is opened, the wonderful taste within will probably be a precursor to there not being very much left in the bottle, for very long....no matter how much you, and/or others in your household  try to restrain yourself! (selves!)<br /><br />If you like grape juice, you will absolutely LOVE this drink.  (If you don't like grape juice, it is possible you won't like FRUIT SQUASH either,,,but to be sure, give it a try anyway...) There is a slightly more sweet, slightly more acidic taste to this drink than plain grape juice has.  Black currants are, I have learnt, a separate variety of small, dried grapes. (Note too that ""currant"" is spelt with an ""A"").<br />Don't let the price scare you off....this is a CONCENTRATE!  The front label directions of this Fruit Squash -- describing milliter servings -- may be a little confusing for those used to ounces, instead of milliliters.... But on another Robinson Prouduct -- the equally scrumptuutious LEMON BARLEY WATER, (also, I must shamelessly admit, reviewed by me for Amazon.com) -- it is more clearly stated:  ONE part Robinson product, to FOUR parts water. Actually, these directions are also on the Apple and Blackcurrant fruit squash....but only on the back label, in far smaller letting.  (Note to Robinson's Sopft Drinks, Limited, and Britvic.com -- PLEASE put these far more clear,<br />""one part Robinson's to four parts water"" directions, on ALL your products, in LARGE lettering, on either front or back label.  Your American and other customers who are more familiar with ounces than they are with milliliters, will thank you!) In any event, this means that each 1 liter bottle, (slightly more than a quart), will make FIVE liters of fruit squash!  This is a bit over one gallon & a quart....and thus the concentrate serves to save LOTS of room in your refrigerator, as well as allowing one to add whatever water, (tap, Evian, distilled, etc.), one wishes!<br /><br />Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant is good either hot or cold.  It's also good to add to recipes....either full or half-strengh...when ""grape juice"" is called for.  But please....use full or half-strength ONLY for recipes! It is tempting, I know, to try the concentrate full-strenght for drinking...and, (as I am, after all, reviewing this product for the benefit of other people), I did take the liberty to do just that, once or twice, (ok, maybe I tried it full-strenght three or four times....just to make sure, and ONLY for testing purposes, you of course understand...: )  Anyway, drinking this product full-strength led, for me anyway, to my heart beating faster than usual.  A danger sign...so I stopped doing it.  Grapes are used to make wine, after all, and though this product is non-fermented, and thus non-alcholic, a strong, concentrated dose of liquid grapes DOES have a negative effect...albeit, for me, (weighing as I do, some more than few pounds overweight), only a slight negative effect.  On the label of both Robinson Proucts which I have tested, in fact, are words of warning to be sure ""to add extra liquid, if given to toddlers, (and children)"".  It is far more economical, and far safer, to follow the directions and add the four parts water for drinking, (and perhaps also cooking), purposes.  The taste is remarkably the same to drinking the concentrate ""straight""...and if, like me, you like things extra, extra sweet, a small bit of extra sugar, (mixed with the smallest amount of boilt water, to dissolve), and or artificial sweetener, can be added.<br /><br />This is, as I have said, a non-alcholic drink.  But it is SO very tasty, so VERY satisfying, that it can be served with pride to even those trying to moderate, or eliminate their consumption of alcholic drinks -- or to those who, for religious or other reasons, have decided to foreswear alcholic drinks altogether.  Diluting it to five or six parts water to one part conentrate make it, I think, the perfect treat for children's birthday parties!<br /><br />It's kind of difficul6 to believe that only 8% of this product is from comcntrated Apple Juice, and only 2% is from concentrated Blackcurrant juice.  The front label proclaims, however, that there are ""NO Artificial<br />Colours or Flavours"" inside, and this is true.  In all, the ingredients listed are: Water.<br />  Fruit jiices from concentrate, (Apple 8%, Blackcurrant 2%)<br />  Glucose-Fructrose syrup<br />  Sugar<br />  Citric Acid<br />  Natural Colour, (Anthocyanins)<br />  Preseratives (Potassium Sorbate,<br />  Sodium Metabisulfite)<br />  Acidity Regulator, (Sodium Citrate)<br />  Sweeteners (Aspartame, Saccarine)<br />  Natural Flavouring<br /><br />  CONTAINS A SOURCE OF PHENYLALANINE.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good label -- especially these days.  NOT entirely natural...but with ingredients found in many other soft drinks, none of which taste quite this good!<br /><br />...................................................................<br /><br />""I can't believe how good they are!""  This is how my sister, visiting my mother and I in New York from her home in Denver, described her first taste of GUYLIAN Belgian Chocolate sea-shells, (also for sale here on Amazon!)  I suppose this was her way of saying ""Scrumtuutious""!  Either way, this also describes the delectable, wonderful taste of ROBINSON'S<br />APPLE & BLACKCURRENT.  Five stars....and, (as the company has been in business sine 1823), a Hundred and Eight-Six ""Cheers!""",0.7

I got the variety pack and tried the Angel hair today and the fettucine yesterday.<br /><br />Don't go into this expecting it to taste like Pasta. Think of it as a substitute for pasta. You have to get used to a lot of things when you switch to a healthier lifestyle. Skim milk instead of 2% for example, when you first try it, it tastes like white water, but later on as you adjust to it, you can taste it as milk. Sweet and Low doesn't taste exactly like sugar either, but it gets the job done in a cup of coffee or tea. Like those, Miracle Noodles is not going to be exactly pasta, any more than say, spaghetti squash is pasta.<br /><br />It doesn't taste bad, it doesn't taste like anything at all. Part of the pleasure of pasta is in tasting the noodles themselves, but this isn't going to be the case for you with Miracle Noodles. You will only taste the flavors of whatever you put on the noodles or whatever you put the noodles into.<br /><br />The texture is rubbery (not as bad as that 'instant jellyfish' I tried from the Asian market, but still rubbery). This is tolerable and I do think I can get used to this. Apparently there are some recipes or techniques for making them less rubbery, I haven't tried those yet. The noodles in my two times eating them have tended to stick together so I have to eat them in clumps. I think this may not be the case if I had them in soup though, but I'll be trying that soon.<br /><br />One thing that was immediately apparent after I ate them was that I had a full, satisfied feeling. It made me feel content and as if I had been well fed even though the only substantial calories had come from the sauce I had put on them. I don't really believe they're calorie free completely, so I log them as 3 calories in my diet log. Still, for the way they fill me up for so few calories, they really feel worth it.<br /><br />So if you want something that is a decent substitute for pasta, which may be something of an acquired taste, then this is for you. If you really care about losing weight you will try whatever interesting foods you need to try in order to do it. This is a way to fill up with very few calories.<br /><br />Even if you don't like it, I think using it once a day is a good option to help people lose weight. Even if you don't like it, just eat it anyway and you'll be full and not hungry anymore. That alone is worth the price. If you do like them, then that's a bonus.",0.58

They are extremely soft and have stayed soft for over 10 days since the initial bake.  They tasted just as good on day 10 as day 1.  We found cooking them two minutes less than the recommendation was adequate and kept them soft.<br /><br />Since going gluten free we have missed the convenience of typical foods many people take for granted, like being able to throw some breaded chicken strips in an oven and have a tasty snack/meal in about 30 minutes.  We decided to make our own with Pamela's mix.  Following the instructions on the pack we cut fresh boneless/skinless chick breasts, put them in milk, and then covered them with the mix(and some salt/pepper/seasoning mix), then fried them in oil.  They tasted amazing and we don't miss the frozen ones at all anymore.  In fact, if we have left overs we throw them in the freezer and pop them in the toaster oven like we use to.",-0.77

It says on the packaging that it is whole milk powder and it should be assumed that it will be just that. I have been interested in purchasing this product for some time and recently found it at a grocery store. I have not had good luck finding a quality powdered milk and this product has satisfied my desire for a quality powdered milk. It has a good flavor and does not taste stale or like cardboard. Of the brands of powdered milk I have tried, many taste so bad I cannot even consume it when I backpack. This is bad because, when backpacking, I need to eat all I can and often will eat all I can and have. Bringing powdered milk I won't drink is a waste of weight I carry and calories I'll never get. I have seriously eaten grape nuts with water because my powdered milk was so stale. This product has a nice rich and creamy flavor that the non-fat milk powders don't have. I prepared this product and drank the result immediately, without any refrigeration and it was already excellent. I think the only other milk powder that I have drank that was good was the carnation non-fat milk. Also, I have used vanilla carnation breakfast drink in place of powdered milk because it works as a milk substitute on the trail. I enjoy this Nido whole milk powder because it is loaded with calories and also because it can be very useful in preparing a number of different normal every day dishes or possibly ethnic at home, such as ice cream, kulfi, or when you want to thicken dairy based foods. I also drink whole milk on a normal basis and prefer to have the fat anyway. However, if I didn't prefer the fat, I would choose this over a bad tasting stale milk powder any day.",0.64

I used an epidural during delivery and even though from what I heard about epidurals making for a longer ""pushing"" stage of labor, mine was actually unbelievably quick! My doctor had me push three times per contraction. Baby crowned within the first contraction, and was born on the third. I pushed for less than ten minutes! Could it have been the tea? I like to think so. This was my first baby, and even doctor and nurses commented on how well it went! I told them it must have been the tea. haha, Since this was first pregnancy I really have nothing to compare it to, but when breastfeeding I do not feel any cramping and had very limited cramping postpartum. A couple of times the day of & day after delivery. I have continued to drink one cup a day since baby's birth.

The taste is really good, for sure much better than any 2% fat milk that you can buy in the supermarket. How does it compare to the taste of 4% fat fresh milk (say for instance Horizon, Or Archer farms)? Well I say that the flavor is the same, parhaps the powdered milk has even better taste since it feels a little bit creamier. However, you have to understand that how creamier it feels dependend on respecting the suggested proportion (4 tablespoons per 236 cubic centimeters).<br /><br />For me the taste is GREAT. Also the preparation is really good, my recomendation is to buy some Shaking glass or use and Hydratation bottle to shake the mix and you will get perfectly homogeneous milk. I use and hydratation bottle at work to prepare my milk, eventually mix it with powdered smoothies like Vega Whole Food Shake.<br /><br />Summarizing: its a really convenient product, tastes like fresh milk (or better), it mixes very well with cold water, the price/liter is very competitive compared to good brands of milk (e.g. Horizon) and you don't need a fridge.

I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.",0.64

It's plenty chocolately, which also means it's quite sugary, but surprisingly, its sugar content is 8g per serving, which is less than a lot of cereals (specifically, the sugary kids' cereals).  Depending on how you feel about sugar, I wouldn't count on it being a ""healthy"" breakfast food, but it sure makes a tasty one.  It's also an excellent snack.  I hate to admit it, but I can eat (and have eaten) a whole box of these in a single day - by myself.<br /><br />Regarding the gluten free issue - all the boxes I've received (and have purchased in local stores) say on them that they are gluten free.

Life was busy, and I wanted a fuss-free way to lose those last pounds before swimsuit season.  Since I enjoy Special K products, I thought I'd put the Special K 2-Week Weight Loss Challenge to the test.  I ate Special K cereal for two meals, snacked on fruits and veggies (instead of the recommend Special K snack products) and made healthy dinner choices.  I didn't expect to lose 6 pounds as advertised, since my weight loss had slowed from months of dieting and I was near my goal weight.  To my surprise, I lost 6 pounds and have finally reached my goal weight!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DIET:<br /><br />It's convenient and doesn't require much planning.  However, it could get a little boring in the long run.  It could also be difficult to meet daily nutritional requirements.  Also, rapid weight loss could be difficult to maintain in the long run.  If you've been dieting and just can't lose those last few pounds, or if you need to lose a few pounds fast for a big event, give Special K a try.<br /><br />ABOUT THE CEREAL:<br /><br />One can usually find a box of Special K in my kitchen cabinet.  Most often, it is the Red Berries variety.  I enjoy the Fruit and Yogurt flavor, as well, but the serving size is 1/4 cup less.  The original flavor is also nice from time to time, but the Chocolatey Delight is just not a good idea, in my opinion.  But back to the Red Berries.  The cereal consists of the usual Special K flakes with dehydrated strawberries.  Once I pour on my Silk Light soy milk, the berries plump up to add lots of real strawberry flavor.  There are generous amounts of berries and the flakes stay crispy in milk.  All in all, this is an excellent cereal that I highly recommend.",0.5

I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.

I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly.

Personally, ever so often I take a sip of Rodeo Drive Blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater. Then that goes away and I enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee.

No. It's good, but it's not my preference, and I might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are, usually Tully's French, Kona, Italian, and House.

Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

We have several friends who also own keurigs as well as different types of k cup holders. We felt that after seeing and hearing their opinions on some of the k cup holders and seeing some of them first hand, we decided we wanted one of the carousel types.... 1. because we felt they were built better 2. They did not seem to fall apart as easy and seem to be of nice, stable structure 3. they seemed to display very well a variety of k cups all while making them easy to get to and use.<br /><br />We did not want to go with the smaller Carousel version, because we wanted one that could hold a large amount. We did have some reservations at first about this model, however all of our nervousness was put to rest once our carousel finally arrived. It is not only sturdy and well built, it also spins smoothly when it is turned, no parts were broken and it can display up to 35 k cups at a time! WE LOVE THIS CAROUSEL!!! It was worth the money spent and we are certain will hold up for many years. It is easy to access the diff k cups, it looks great on our counter next to our keurig and soda machine, and it is also not too tall so that it easily stores underneath our cabinets without issues!!

I picked up a bottle of this horsecrap at Lowe's after trying some of the EcoSMART Mosquito & Tick Control and failing to eradicate my backyard mosquito problem. I figured, how hard could it be to manufacture a garden hose attached spray bottle and adhere to Bernoulli's principle. Apparently the answer is ""very.""<br /><br />I followed the directions line by line to be sure I didn't screw anything up. I shook the container well. I attached the garden hose to my ready spray nozzle. I made sure the dial was in the off position. Then when I got to step 4 all hell broke loose. I turned the water on carefully (at the faucet, just like the directions said). I hadn't even turned the water on all the way, maybe just 25%, and I noticed from across the lawn that the ready spray nozzle was readily spraying water out the back of the nozzle at extreme pressure. I mean EXTREME pressure. Little tiny streams of super pressurized water that could cut through flesh with more efficiency than a .50 caliber. That lasted for approximately 7 seconds until the entire hose, complete with the screw-on portion of the ready spray nozzle, exploded away from the rest of the container and fired the hose back about 3 feet.<br /><br />Like any good homeowner would do at that point, I turned off the water and strolled over to survey the damage. Thankfully, it looked repairable. I unscrewed the blue screw-end off the hose, making sure that the rubber washer came with it and then forcefully jammed it back onto the end of the nozzle. Maybe I had screwed it onto the hose too tightly, maybe I had turned the water on too fast with too much pressure. I figured what the hell, I'll try it again. 2nd time, same result. 3rd time, same result.<br /><br />For my next attempt I figured I'd outsmart the bugger and skip ahead a few steps. So before turning the water on, I bent the safety tab back and turned the dial clockwise until it stopped. I thought to myself, ""Sweet, water will automatically mix with the product when I turn the hose on and I'll eliminate my back pressure problem. Rock on."" Naturally my next move was to turn the water on. In hindsight, this was clearly a terrible move. I turned the water on and from the other side of the lawn everything looked to be in order. The sprayer was spraying and the hose was still attached. I jogged over and picked up the bottle and started to walk at a steady pace while spraying using an even sweeping motion, slightly overlapping the areas to be treated. But as soon as I moved the bottle around a little bit, the little tiny streams of super pressurized flesh destroying water returned with a vengeance and began nailing me in the face with anger and rage. I refused to lose and restrained both the hose and the nozzle with both hands using an overhand death grip most likely taught in MMA schools throughout Brazil and other parts of South America.<br /><br />I finally had it under control. The spray was coming out the right end and the hose remained attached to the bottle. Never mind that the muscles in my hands were quickly starting to burn from the sheer force that I had to apply to keep the whole system intact and operating. But whatever, it was working. After a couple minutes of running around my yard like a blind monkey on acid, I decided to look into the clever little window they build into the side of the bottle to make sure that the chemical was actually coming out with the stream of water. Nothing. Hadn't gone down even a centimeter. I set the bottle onto the ground carefully making sure not to loosen up the insanity driven choke grip that I had on the bottle and I watched. I watched for 5 minutes. I smelled the spray coming out looking for any sign of the chemicals. Nothing. Not a god damned thing. The only thing coming out of that sprayer was water.<br /><br />I blinked. It must have been a little longer than average because by the time I opened my eyes the whole thing was over. I was soaking wet. Shoes, shirt, shorts, face, everything. The bottle was laying several feet away. The hose was by my side quietly pouring water onto the lawn. A bird chirped in the distance. At least it was over. After a good fight it was time to accept defeat and move on with my life.<br /><br />I may never be the same after this day. I suspect that the events will be replayed in my mind over and over until I'm left drooling in a corner somewhere mumbling to myself. But before that happens I must warn the others.

Irresponsible, in my opinion.  I detest the aftertaste of splenda, not mentioned alongside ""Emerald Roast Almonds Dark Chocolate flavor"" until you read the itty-bitty ingredients text.  Strong black coffee and a slowly nursed-along glass of porter ale over the next few hours finally washed my mouth clean enough to take my mind off of the experience.  When I see an Emerald nut package, it still reminds me of that nasty surprise.<br /><br />The canister went into the trash and I complained to Emerald.  They haven't acknowledged my complaint, and they continue to market artificially sweetened nuts without clearly labeling them as such.

I'm always seeking natural and holistic remedies to help with the pain and stiffness and cherry juice came up in my research as something to try.

If the star rating were for this aspect I would award 2.5-3 stars.<br /><br />The Knudsen company does not make any health claims regarding this product so as far as a beverage I would give it 4 stars. I agree with the reviews that state this does have a somewhat prune-like flavor to it. One person stated it tastes like 70% cherry and 30% prune and I would agree with that statement.<br /><br />Conclusion: I was pleased to see this juice had helped so many reviewers with their arthritis and gout; as a juice product only I think the cherry flavor is good but may not be for everyone because of the strong note of prune flavor.",0.48

I will note it is GRITTIER than R.K., but that's cause it's simpler (not a long list of ingredients) and uses brown rice. It doesn't stay crispy as long as traditional R.K., so only pour your milk/almond milk/soymilk/etc when you're ready to chow down.<br /><br />For folks avoiding gluten (but not low carb, obviously), this is a nice cereal for when one wants something other than eggs.

These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.<br /><br />They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.

An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.<br /><br />For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.  Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges?  These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers.

That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE.

But after a while I miss that vanilla creaminess and begin the hunt anew. Plus, caramel is my favorite sweet candy, though I prefer sour candies. But as a child who went through two sets of braces, caramel was not a treat I was allowed to indulge in often. But every Halloween I would buy a bag of those Caramel Apple suckers, braces be damned, and make them last for ages. My love affair with caramel has been a long and torrid one.<br /><br />Anyway, caramel brings out those feel-good feeling in me. So of course when I was ordering my Green Apple matcha from Red Leaf Teas, the caramel (found here:[...]) had to tumble into my cart too! I have to try them mixed, or I'll be doing my teenage self a grave disservice. But first, I'm going to try it by itself, with sugar added, of course. If it's anything like their French Vanilla, I'm in for a treat. I'm trying to try all of the new ones, but all I want to do is return to that little gem.<br /><br />On to the caramel! I'm only making a small cup of this as it is 9:30 at night and I want to sleep at some point. But hey, sleep is for the weak and matcha-less, right? Right. The smell is amazing. Like I just want to crawl into the package and spend the rest of forever there. The taste...mmm. Mmmmm....mmmm. Okay, it tastes like....mmmm. Maybe I needed a bigger cup. A soup bowl, perhaps. Guh...mmmm. It tastes like the French Vanilla, but with a lovely burnt sugar aftertaste that is rocking my world right now. It tastes like real caramel made on the stovetop with nothing but sugar, cream, and a big mess that is completely worth it. Mmmmm. When I was in high school, at a church carnival I won a caramel cake. It was a caramel-flavored cake that was laced with real caramel bits, caramel icing and drizzled with, you guessed it, caramel. This reminds me of that. Or the caramel pie from O'Charley's, which was essentially a pie crust filled with caramel. This is amazing, and I want to order some with the ""There's matcha in this?"" flavoring option so I can just drown in the caramelly goodness. This is a must-always-have-in-stock for me.",0.45

To render the oil from fish requires a technological approach. If you keep improving the technique, the fish residue eventually has so little oil that a cat might not be able to detect it. The ""food"" would be produced from fresh fish, as advertised, and would allow the manufacturer to receive a revenue from the residue as well as the human supplement.

We found the fat & sugar content to be better than most grocery store options but an area where they can still imrpove.  therefore, we limit our enjoyment of this admittitedly delicious product for use as a topping on our own homemade yogurt and as the base upon which we build our dry snacks.  WE found there weren't enough dehydrated fruit bits for the fruit taste to come through so we add some more of our own <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039QW2V2"">Harmony House Foods Freeze-Dried Strawberries, whole (2 oz, Quart Size Jar)</a> as well as some conventionally dried golden raisins.  That works nicely as a yogurt topping and also as good topping for either store bought or homemade icrecream of soft-serve.  If we want to eat it as a cereal, we find we need to add some more home-toasted rolled oats - any brand will do, the cheaper the better just make sure you give them a light toast on a Cookie Sheet.  it brings out the nuttiness in the flavor.  I'd say for each Cereal serving we add maybe another tablespeoon of dehydrated berries, 4 or 5 chopped golden raisins and an extra scant handful of toasted rolled oats.<br /><br />This is not to say that the Nature's Path Love Crunch Dark Chocolate & Red Berries Granola doesn't taste great AS IS, it's just we were expecting more of a berry ZING given the description.  When we eat it plain as a cereal, we want to taste more berry so that's why we left off 1 star.  As a yogurt topping, it also works fine on it's own but adding the extra dehydrated berries, like you find in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006W5WDS4"">Special K Red Berries Cereal, 16.7 Ounce Box (Pack of 3)</a>,  adds even more crunch.  Some people have also said they don't find the chocolate taste coming through but I found the taste of it as a Cereal of Yogurt topper to be just fine.  if I were going to have this as a Snack, I recommend, a few inexpensive addtions to stretch the item out and add a little more of a nutritional boost:<br /><br />To make the Snack Mix that our family loves to pack in lunches, also known as ""How to Hack your Storebought granola into a snack mix""  -- we have added some home toasted almond slivers and to augment the admittedly small amounts of chocolate pieces in the mix, we toss in a healtheir choice than plain chocolate and use some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071EBP2K"">Nibbles Organic Dark Chocolate Cacao Nibs</a> that have a slightly sweetened dark chocolate covering over the naturally crunchy and unsweetened Cocao Nib in the middle. That punches up the Chocolate quotient nicely without adding too much to the sugar load.  To this we then add even more of the toasted rolled oats mentioned above, which are cheaper than dirt.  Oats are a whole grain, good fuel for on-the-go kids and they hardly notice when it's mixed into a ""store bought fancy Granola"" alone with the extra berries and Cocao Nibs!  If you still need to stretch it further or just want some variety, we have tried adding some slightly crushed whole wheat pretzels we get locally that are only lightly salted with sea salt, some toasted pepitos (pumpkin seeds), and some generic cornflakes.  That makes up quite a goodly amount of snack mix with enough crunch and taste to satisfy every snacker in our household.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I liked this Brand and Flavor right out of the bag and could have eaten the entire thing as a snack but after one or two bite, I did want more crunch and more of a Berry/Chocolate thing going on.  The simplest fix is to find the cheapest Dehydrated Strawberries you can on Amazon or locally AND  a Cocao Nib NOT covered in dark chocolate since that will save you a little bit in the sugar to carbs ratio and the calroies from fat area without sacrificing any crunch or chocolate and berry flavor.  In fact, the SIMPLEST fix is to just add more dehydrated strawberries and this would be a 5-star item.<br /><br />I've written to the company to sugest that and also suggest they consider adding plain Cacao Nibs to their forumla since those are actually a formerly under-appreciated by-product of the chocolate making  process and can be sourced cheaply if purchased in large enough quantities.  I believe those 2 rather minor tweaks to the recipe coul make Love Crunch fly off the shelves!",0.71

The pulp both adds and detracts from the experience - it tends to have both a sharp and sweet flavor when bitten into.

I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is ""healthy"", and would argue against it being ""edible"".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.

I was pretty happy with it....here are the pros/cons:<br /><br />I like that it packs 11 grams of fiber (44% of your daily intake), 22 grams of protein, 10% iron and 10% vitamin c. The salmon spread is pretty tasty with a little bit of spice to it, but not too much, crackers, a generous serving of dry roasted edamame, Fruit & Nut mix and an organic dark chocolate square.  I really liked the fruit/nut mix and the ginger was not overpowering.  It was a tasty mix of dried fruit, bananas and ginger peanuts....very tasty.<br /><br />The couple things we would like to change: you need more crackers-I think about 8 would be just about right, as you seem to have salmon spread left over unless you heap it on.  Also, a knife would be helpful to spread it, along with the fork that is included OR ditch the round crackers and use square crackers that would be easier to just dip into the spread.<br /><br />Overall, not a gigantic amount of food, it seemed to have proper food proportions and is perfect for one person who eats sensibly.  As it has a lot of fiber I would keep in mind that drinking enough fluids would be important with a to-go meal like this one.<br />As far as the food, it was a nice little meal that I would keep for the office or in a backpack when I hike.<br /><br />I would consider buying a couple of these to have on hand and would recommend them for those that need a quick meal.",0.98

So for me, this is a good, low calorie choice, and it's a great choice for hot mornings in the summer, sipping it for my a.m. caffeine ""fix"" on my way to work. And I like it on the weekends instead of hot coffee as well.<br /><br />The Nantucket Iced Blend works REALLY well in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007L877MI"">Keurig Vue</a>. The Vue is a new version of the Keurig single cup coffee machine, and it has a bunch of new features compared to the current K-cup machines (and by the way, you can get this iced blend in K-cups.) The Vue lets you choose an iced setting that is at an ideal temperature for brewing,  and lets you adjust volume for your desired strength. You can also brew it stronger. The Vue does NOT use K-cups. It uses the Vue cup which is recyclable.<br /><br />The instructions:<br />Fill a 16 oz NON-GLASS (important!) mug with ice<br />Set the Vue to Iced Beverage, put in the Vue cup<br />Choose 6 oz (optimum for over-ice, but you can opt for weaker)<br />Choose Strong (again, the ice dilutes it.)<br />Brew.<br /><br />Why no glass? The addition of hot liquids into a chilled, icy glass can cause your glass to break. I brewed in a ceramic mug, but a metal insulated travel mug is another option.<br /><br />Stronger? Well, the ice dilutes the coffee a lot, so even if you like a light brew, you might find either a lower volume or a stronger brew would be ideal for your tastes. I preferred 6 oz and STRONG setting and got a cup brewed directly onto ice that tastes great. Either way, you can customize the settings on the Vue to make your iced coffee the way you like it.<br /><br />This Vue cup is longer (holding more coffee) to allow for a stronger blend, but there is no reason you can't brew another blend over ice using the ICED BEVERAGE setting.

It definitely fits into the catagory of organic health foods for its purported nutritional content as well.  The energy I personally felt was very subtle, not much like so many dietary supplements and drinks out there that gets one juiced up to the point of jitters. If taken for the first time, a slight numbing sensation can be felt in the mouth and throat areas.  The sensitivity to the numbing sensation appears to fade a bit with ongoing consumption. As far as an appetite suppressant for me, it works to a slight degree, probably depending on the amount. According to one coca tea blogspot website, the coca leaf contains 14 alkaloids:  Atropine, Inuline, Benzoyne, Reserpine, Cocamine, Conine, Quinoline, Pyridine, Globuline, Hygrine, Papaine, Pectin, Egnonin, and Cocaine--one gram of crushed leaves contains 5.3mg of which only 4.42mg of it is released during a 3 minute steep in 180ml of hot water.<br /><br />  Of the listed alkaloids, Cocamine is becoming popular in dietary supplement blends that are geared towards those needing energy for workouts and such.  From my personal experience ALRI's Venom Hyperdrive is a good synergistic blend of vitamin b-12, cocamine,hoodia gordinii, etc. that have worked well for me in getting appetite supression and high energy for workouts.<br /><br />  By the way, the natives supposedly use a minute amount of an alkalinic additive to enhance the potency (by improving extraction) of the coca leaf's alkaloids.  They are little ash/lime balls called Llipita(available online) and they can be pulverized and sprinkled upon your beverage like pinches of salt.

It has worked very well in providing a balanced meal high in all required vitamins plus Omega 3, 6, and 9. The large kibble keeps our cats from requiring periodic dental cleanings. Our present pair of Maine Coons have NEVER required a dental cleaning in 8 years.<br />The only problem we have had with this product is the size of the bag. It is too small. Maine Coons are BIG eaters, a 6 pound bag doesn't last long ( 1 week) with 2 full grown Maine Coons. Royal Canin did pack the food in a 20(?) pound bag some time ago, but discontinued that size because of complaints of lack of ""freshness"". How could a Mylar bag packed product be ""unfresh""? Whose opinion of lack of freshness was it, the Owner?, the retailer? the Cat? or the manufacturer?<br />What do breeders of Maine Coons do? They do NOT buy $25 bags of 6 pounds of kibble. They seek out competitive equivalents to feed their cats, use MC-31 sparingly, but advise their customers of what is the best and what is reasonable to feed these big guys.<br />A vet tech suggested Amazon as the most reasonably priced source of Royal Canin MC-31.

However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.

Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress.

I find it difficult to enjoy healthier options because I do have such a sweet tooth but with the vanilla and the blueberry mixed in with these grains I don't miss the sugar.

While reading the back label it actually say's you can add milk and have it just that way. I've yet to do that because I brought this product into work to have as a breakfast filler. It works perfectly for that as helps control your appetite. It fills me up and I feel good knowing it's a healthier option than what I'd usually go for.<br /><br />For me I'm so happy I found this product. Its low in sugar, full of Omega-3, and is made with 100% whole grains. They suggest trying this on top of yogurt or with milk.

However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.

That said, the energy bars taste pretty amazing too, and are a better alternative for strict vegans (sweetened with brown rice syrup and tapioca syrup instead of honey).<br /><br />To note, the Rise Energy Bars are very sweet, and almost dessert-like in my opinion.

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",0.97

You're want specifically named sources of protein like ""chicken"" or ""chicken meal"" and  you do not want things like ""meat byproduct.""  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the ""Holistic""label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.",-0.82

Still, you are told not to steep green tea for more than a couple minutes or else the bitter flavor comes out.

This Taiwan tea by comparison is a true powder.  It is difficult to dissolve, clumping a quite a bit, and produces a flavor that within a few minutes in hot water becomes bitter, then later even more bitter.<br /><br />UPDATE: It turns out you use a lot less of it than you do of the Japanese matcha I had.  The powder, since it is so fine, goes much further.  To help you with this, they have a spoon in the box to right-size the servings.  I was using a much larger teaspoon instead previously.

The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips.

If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.",0.58

About 6 weeks ago she developed a urinary problem.  She would lie down for a nap and suddenly stand up in a puddle of water. She also began wetting the bed and seemed to have no control over it.  We took her to the vet who immediately said no more food or treats from China and sent us to a specialist who tested her for just about everything (very uncomfortable for her, upsetting for us and very expensive).  We just got the final test results back and she has been diagnosed with Fanconi's Syndrome.  There's not too much we can do except pray that the kidney damage reverses itself.  We're cautiously optimistic because since she hasn't had one of these deadly duck strips she's regained some control over her urination and hasn't wet the bed in 6 nights.<br />Please, please, please DO NOT give your precious pet anything made in China but most especially these horrible, deadly treats.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XZNCFA"">PCI Quackers Duck Tenders, 2- 1lb.

It's quite runny.<br /><br />However, do I really care if my syrup is kinda watery?? NOPE.<br />This stuff can't be perfect, but if the only thing wrong with it is the fact that's it a little thinner than regular syrup, then bring it on. I can deal with that. If you simply must have super-thick consistency to your syrup, then you might find this off-putting.<br /><br />It tastes extremely close to regular ol' maple syrup from the restaurant.

Vitamin Squeeze is different than other water additives because of, well, the vitamins.  It boasts Vitamins C, B3, B5, B6, and B12, Caffeine, something called Taurine and of course what drink these days would not complete with Electrolytes, whatever those are.  And it does seem to be working because I have notice I have not have as many of those mid-afternoon sluggish feeling since adding it to my lunch water and there is no crash associated from drinking.  It took me a little over a month of near daily use the whole bottle which is good because the packaging says for the best quality to use within thirty days after opening.<br /><br />With the vitamin Squeeze in the water, it kind of taste like the Gatoraide Fruit Punch.  But the biggest problem with the product is getting the right amount of additive into the water.  Not get enough in and the drink tastes watered down (naturally) and put too much in and it taste almost like medicine.  But unlike other water enhancers on the market which just sits in the bottom that you have to stir up, I never needed to stir the Vitamin Squeeze.

53243,0,30.0,Male,3.0,0,12.0,3.0,2.0,236.03,"Seemed worth a try at first, but, with use, it's really hateful.","Just got my first bottle. Delivery unproblematic: fulfilled by ""Amazon LLC.""; seems of good quality; came very fast. Like Barlean's flax oil, it comes in a non-trasparent-black, squeezable, very soft plastic bottle with a valve in the spout. The bottle is sealed under the cap: you gotta unscrew the cap and peel off the seal before you can use it. Press date is in September, which is a bit old, but otoh, hemp oil isn't as perishable as flax oil, so maybe it's OK.<br /><br />Since I've just learned of the purported health benefits of this oil, I can only comment on the taste of it: on the bottle, and here, and elsewhere online, hempseed oil is said to have a really nice, ""nutty"" flavour. Well, not true: actually, it's more medicinal/grassy, reminiscent of rosemary. Not unpleasant, but nothing special -- actually, flax is marginally better (though I don't particularly like it either). I suspect that were it not for their purported healthfulness, no one would use either of these oils. But supposedly they're good, so we'll see. Unlike flax oil (which has some solids floating in it and needs to be shaken up before use), hemp oil has a homogeneous consistency -- like any other cooking oil, except for the colour: a sort of of luminous green, believe it or not; quite a bit like antifreeze. So these are my initial impressions; I'll update this review if I discover anything noteworthy as I use it.<br /><br />12/28/10: I have to bring the stars down: the taste is horrible; in a matter of days I've grown to hate it -- it's like a greasy medicine of some sort, an emetic. There's _nothing_ it's good with, it SPOILS the taste of anything you add it to. Why do health foods taste so bad? Are they really healthful or it's just hype 'cause the maker wants to sell it? I really can't recommend this product (though it was delivered fine, and in good packaging, so the manufacturing part is fine; just the oil itself is horrible). Flax oil is far less disgusting.<br /><br />01/08/2011: Just poured the remaining half-bottle down the toilet. A solemn moment of personal liberation. Healthful my as.",0.77

We discussed this (argued, actually...) and decided to order some fruit punch so we'd have a break from drinking the water here (it has lots of minerals and tastes like poison).  We ordered five 4-packs of this fruit punch, there are four of us and figured it would last awhile.  But we were shocked when we opened the package.  The bottles are only 1.6 ounces - this is less than one twentieth of a liter, or one thousandth of a cubic foot!  The hole under the cap is very tiny, you can't drink from it or even fit a straw.  We cut them open with knives and tried to soothe our parched throats, but the mixture is so extremely sweet it only made us thirstier.  Plus the shape of the bottle is very hard to keep on the handlebars of your bicycle if it is in motion.

My homemade coffee does not compare with the illy's made coffee.

I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I've tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you've had good vanilla you'll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don't think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested)",0.89

I bought it and added a splash of red wine, a bit of garlic, some fresh frozen basil leaves crumbled up and a dash of salt and pepper.

Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451WLYI"">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a>), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even though it's now no longer summer, this is still my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I use one bottle, then refill it with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!",0.89

Do your research!,"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.",0.58

Yes it is expensive, but it is difficult to find locally so I figured I would buy a couple in order to freeze some so I wouldn't have to re-order.<br /> The order arrived on time as promised (I ordered 1 day shipping to ensure freshness)<br />When I opened the box I found that the top loaf had been reduced to a bag of crumbs because apparently there is a shortage of packing material in California.<br /> When I tasted the bread I was very disappointed. I was not expecting a blast of flavor but I did expect, based on previous reviews, at least SOME flavor. Instead what I got was the DRYEST, most bland taste one can imagine. I might as well have been eating the cardboard box it arrived in.<br /> To be fair, it did taste somewhat better toasted with butter on it, but not very much (and that defeats the purpose).<br />Bottom line is that the bread tastes horrible, and that is only if you can find a piece of it that doesn't crumble in your fingers.",-0.45

53387,0,19.0,Male,3.0,0,13.0,2.0,9.0,169.47,A great organic chocolate option - dark chocolate for people who don't like dark chocolate?,"THE QUICK TAKE:  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate is a great chocolate option.  At 54% cocoa solids, it's just over the edge of dark chocolate.  So it makes a nice change for those wanting dark chocolate that isn't so dark.  And, it's sustainably and responsibly produced - making it as guilt-free as chocolate gets.  The price at Amazon varies and can be high, so you'll need to look at the current price and your other options to decide what works for you.<br /><br />TASTE AND TEXTURE:  To have a little fun, we did a taste comparison to some other chocolate we had in the house.  The Newman's Own Dark Chocolate compared well to other premium and organic chocolate we had. It's decidedly darker, less sweet and firmer than a milk chocolate, with a very nice texture both to chew and on the tongue.  And it has some really nice subtleties to the flavor.  But it's not nearly as strong as what aficionados would consider a ""dark"" chocolate.  So it's a good option that might just hit the (bitter)sweet spot you are looking for in chocolate.<br /><br />PRICE:  These bars are relatively expensive.  That's to be expected for a premium chocolate that's organically produced.  We're lucky enough to have a lot of options for locally for organic chocolate.  Newman's Own is an excellent product, but you will want to compare it to the other options available to you.<br /><br />PRODUCTION: There are two important aspects that make this chocolate as guilt-free as chocolate gets:<br /><br />First, organic production.  Newman's Own has one of the largest organic chocolate sourcing operations in the world, which is highly commendable.  So you and your family get great tasting chocolate without consuming other things you don't want to eat; and, you also get the knowledge that the producers are working to minimize the impact of your consumption on the places where the chocolate is grown.<br /><br />Second, responsible sourcing.  Far too few people know that most of the world's cocoa production is tainted by child labor and often forced labor - or, in plain terms, slavery.  If that's news to you, Google chocolate slavery for some eye-opening information.  Or have a look at some of the Amazon listings, such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN1VQ"">Bitter Chocolate: The Dark Side of the World's Most Seductive Sweet</a>.<br /><br />All of that is a lot to fit into a chocolate bar - but Newman's Own has done that, and more, and offers you a lot of excellent options in chocolate.  If this one doesn't suit you, there are several more on Amazon.",0.91

I was wrong.<br /><br />First, the bag looked like it had been on a shelf for several years.  The plastic was severely scuffed and the label was very worn, as if it had been shifted around in a bin for a very long amount of time.  There was no roasting date or expiration date, so it's impossible to ascertain how old the beans really are.  Isn't that illegal these days?<br /><br />Secondly, the beans have almost no smell and are not even slightly oily.  Compared to a really good bean, such as the Java Trading Company's Espresso Jet City, these are an utter failure.  Even when finely ground, these Organic Camano Island Peru Decaf. have almost no aroma, and what little they do have is not appealing.  It literally smells like caked dirt, not like coffee should smell.  Sure, it's dark roasted, but even the inside of the bag is suspiciously missing even a hint of the oils prevalent on top quality beans.<br /><br />Lastly, when brewed in either a pump espresso maker, a French press, or a drip coffee machine, the brew's complete lack of crema, body, or aroma is the final nail in the coffin.  Starbucks is better than this stuff.  This Camano Islands Peru Decaf isn't just slightly bad; it isn't even worthy of being placed in a Folger's can.<br /><br />Please look elsewhere for a good decaf organic bean, and don't make the same mistake I did.",-0.77

I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.

Yeah, I have 14xs the normal taste bud count and twice the depth, crazy but it makes me very aware of nuances for good and bad)... almond ones tend to have a grit; in some the salt and sugar (and cocoa in the chocolate ones) just don't ever quite join the nut blend... and no way am I drinking soy. This is PERFECT to carry with me when I am worried about temperature (so I keep a box of the 4 individuals around but actually usually take the whole 32oz one--I drink it in 3 sittings tops, usually the same day).<br /><br />Pacific foods also have amazing customer service; funny, I moved to Seattle from the east coast and having consumed it over a full year there, it suddenly was not known (the chocolate variety) ANYWHERE just a few hours from their plant in stores that have more Pacific brand broths, milks, and such than all other brands combined. They were awesome about getting it here for me (also before Amazon carried it); not sure why it costs so much with Amazon compared to a SEATTLE grocer since um Amazon is in Seattle, too, but glad for the backup regardless, hoping I never need to pay this much!<br /><br />Having had Pacific's oat, almond, hazelnut... And then Almond Breeze (the other good chocolate variety, sweetened that is, the unsweet isn't so palettable)... This is the best. The plain hazelnut milk is super smooth and great for making my own custom flavored drinks when I run out of my loved Alpenrose dairy goods (amazing milk)... This is definitely great for potential power outrages, winter storms... Great backup for perishable dairy goods! It is well worth $3/each, mind you, or grab the $28/case recurring and set it a few months away and see if you aren't hooked!!

I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.

He used to eat them crushed in a small helping of Friskies Appetizers (tuna or salmon) which he ate dependably... but lately he'd become picky and not interested in the Appetizers any more.  We'd gotten to where we were doing the ""gently pinch the jaw and shove the pill back"" routine which neither of us liked.<br /><br />These pill pockets make getting him his meds easy and pleasant, and we're both happy not to have the thrice-daily confrontations.  It's a soft treat in the shape of a small cylinder with the top missing- tuck the pill in, pinch it closed, roll it around to make a ball and it's set.

It did not look too appetizing at first glance.  The dark chocolate coating was spotted over 50 percent with a tan color, not the deep dark chocolate color shown on the outer cover of the box.  About every third cookie had separated the cracker part from the creamy half.  And about a quarter of them sported cracked tops with the white showing through. Like everything else nowadays, the cookie is smaller than the original I remember.<br />So far, not too appetizing, but hey, I eat broken cookies all the time, however the spotted coating reminded me of candy that was improperly stored.<br />So I popped one in my mouth.<br />My first impression as I chewed a Mallomars cookie. A very sweet treat just like I remembered from years ago.  Despite the discoloration the chocolate flavor was acceptable but not that rich dark chocolate taste my mouth was watering for from the picture on the box.  The cracker portion was dry but soon combined with the marshmallow filling while chewing.  After three I found them too sweet to have more at one sitting.<br />Overall, the taste was a four star.  However, appearance of food is a big part of eating and tasting.  The box of Mallomars I received did not make the cookie appear appetizing.

IT NO LONGER CONTAINS LEMON JUICE AND HAS A STRONG SOUR VINEGAR TASTE. THEY ALSO INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES IN THE DRESSING. THERE ARE VERY FEW MILD, LOW CAL, NON SWEET VINEGRETTES OUT THERE. IT'S A SHAME THAT KRAFT KILLED THIS ONE.<br /><br />--OLD REVIEW--<br /><br />This is a refreshing light and not very  sweet vinagrette that tastes more of lemon juice than vinegar and has a nice garlic and pepper kick.<br /><br />In this day and age of sugary and gummy diet dressings this awesome dressing is a breath of fresh air!!<br /><br />I believe this is Krafts original vinaigrette dressing which leads me to one caveat: Like it did in the old days, it contains MSG. Now unless you are sensitive to MSG, this is actually a very GOOD THING. It makes the salad sing with taste even though the dressing only has 50 calories in two tablespoons. That would not be possible without MSG and which is why I think so many salad dressings these days are sugary bland disasters - because the manufacturers are afraid to add MSG. Sometimes  politically incorrect ingredients from the old days are great!<br /><br />I love to use 2 or three tablespoons of this dressing over a huge veggie and feta cheese salad... it makes those veggies sing on your tongue!!!<br /><br />Get it quick, I heard rumors that Kraft may be thinking of killing this product off.

It takes less than 30 seconds to put 1/2 cup through a roller mill.

There are only 3 grams of fat in a .8 oz snack bag, so they are much better for you then regular chips and if I remember correctly, are even healthier than the regular potato popchips. Personally, I thought the chips were just OK, but my daughter and husband love them, so I averaged out our reviews to end up with 4 stars.<br /><br />When I first bit into a chip I found it intensely sweet but then quickly I tasted the salt and it formed a nice balance, though after eating several I did find them more sweet than salty overall. They are really very light and not at all greasy. If you are a fan of sweet potatoes, you will probably like these chips. If sweet potatoes aren't your thing, these probably won't sway you (they didn't for me).",0.88

This is the second time I've opened a shirataki noodle package expecting to be knocked back by a horrible smell, only to smell nothing but a mild odor reminiscent of some soy-based product.<br /><br />As for the noodles themselves, the texture didn't have that strange ""cartilage-like"" feel of fettucine-style Miracle Noodles. However, they were very rubbery and stretchy, requiring a lot of chewing. Personally, I found nothing offensive about this texture but those expecting it to have the consistency of spaghetti might find themselves disgusted or just plain disappointed by it, since these are being touted as a substitute for pasta.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, these noodles have none. This poses a huge problem for those hoping to turn to them to ""lose weight."" This becomes all too apparent when you come across recipes from other users for this product. More often than not, the recipes often call for rich, fattening sauces; meats, fish, seafood; and other ingredients that usually bump up the calories a hundred-fold. (One recipe I saw-- kid you not-- involved fried pork sausage!}<br /><br />Why do recipes for shirataki noodles tend to go overboard? Well, since they have no flavor, you can't just boil them up as you would other noodles and eat them with a basic soup base or sauce. You have to literally drown them in tons of other stuff to make them filling. So whatever health benefits you gain by substituting carbs with these shirataki noodles is canceled out by the calories and sodium you wind up tacking on from the sauces and other junk you have to add to make them ""work.""<br /><br />All in all, a ""so-so"" product-- not bad, not great. Adventurous chefs and eaters who like to try new things may get a kick out of them, because of the interesting texture and cooking challenge they pose. Dieters on the other hand may want to steer clear. Because these noodles have no taste, they'll find themselves needing to add so many ingredients that they may as well just be cooking a ""regular"" meal with these as nothing more than a side dish. In addition, this product isn't necessarily the best substitute for pasta, because the texture couldn't be more different. Three stars.",-0.54

My advice is to cut one up into small flakes about the size of crushed red pepper flakes & then put one flake in your mouth.  A co-worker who eats jalapenos every day popped a flake in his mouth, jumped outta his chair screaming, and spit it out into the trash.  I personally thought that was overly dramatic, as it shouldn't have been that bad, but that one flake is definitely hotter than a whole jalapeno.  The smoke flavor is great.  I put about 5 flakes into a bowl of chili and let them sit there & infuse into the sauce before I took my first bite.  The heat wasn't overpowering at all, neither was it harsh like Tabasco is, but had a very satisfying warmth that spread quickly all through my mouth, and the smokiness was a fantastic addition to chili.  Who woulda thought.  So these aren't just for playing a practical joke on your friends.  You can actually use them in cooking with good results.

In addition, I have some loose rooibos from a local tea specialty store called Virtuous Teas.<br /><br />Of all of these rooibos (or rooibos-containing) teas, the Teavana Tropica is the worst by far.<br /><br />Firstly, it is difficult to even tell if it contains any actual rooibos; any such flavoring is completely overwhelmed by citris.  Given that the tea is actually *called* a rooibos tea, I find this completely unnacceptable.<br /><br />It would be another matter if rooibos was simply listed as one of the ingredients.  For example, the Salada green tea I mentioned doesn't pretend to be a rooibos tea.  ""Rooibos"" is listed as a constituent (along with lycopene, anthocyanins and vitamin C), but the tea is called ""Green Tea Fortified with Red Antioxidants.""  Although the Salada tea is not called a rooibos tea, it is much richer in rooibos flavor than Teavana's so-called ""Rooibos Tropica.""  Teavana's tea should simply be called ""Tropica"" with rooibos listed as an ingredient (if there is any actual rooibos present ... I'm not convinced).<br /><br />Secondly, the tea's ""tropical"" constituents manage to produce a cloying experience in a tea that is otherwise too weak.  I have not been able to brew a pot that had any satisfying tea impact whatsoever -- it has always felt too weak regardless of how much tea I've used -- yet making it stronger simply imparts more of the bad tropical mix.  And the tropical mix *is* bad, as if I steeped some orange peels and random flower petals in hot water.<br /><br />This tea dissapoints on multiple levels.

This coffee is strong, but not too strong, and good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.

It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called ""premium"" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.

Big, rectangular pieces of chocolate, that dominate the taste of this snack.  If you love chocolate like I do, you'll like this snack.<br /><br />Now, my next question would be, how healthy is this?  I was for some reason expecting this to be another ""faux healthy"" snack like so many of the granola bars you find these days, which are loaded with hydrogenated oils and artificial flavorings.  The ingredients list of this granola is 100% comprised of things YOU could buy at the grocery store!  Sugar, skim milk, molasses, etc.. even the preservative is plain old vitamin E.<br /><br />Next I was curious about the calorie/sugar/fat content as compared to my usual granola, Kashi Apple Orchard.  This product (same serving size) has 1 gram less of total fat (though saturated fat is 1 g more than the Kashi), 1 gram less of carbohydrates, and one less grab of protein.  Total calories are the same per serving.  Contrasting with the Kashi, I would never eat this for breakfast since my days of chocolate (Count Chocula) early in the morning are long since past.

I have used this yeast for a long time in the past, but I suspect when the company changed hands in 2004 something happened to the production, as the yeast has decreased in quality by a GREAT amount since then.<br /><br />This yeast, while it does work, is not active enough to properly make REALLY good bread. This is a ""get by"" kind of yeast that should be bought in a grocery store as a last resort.<br /><br />The yeast needs a significant amount of added sugar to properly activate, and even then this is unreliable. I have had some batches of this yeast simply fail to proof at all. Generally only good for pan baking, as opposed to freeform or artisan baking. The yeast does not provide enough leavening during the baking process to rise the loaf in the oven after the transfer to the baking stone. (Transfer in artisan bread tends to degass the dough slightly). Loaves end up flat and the crumb very dense.<br /><br />If you are truly serious about your baking I highly suggest picking up some SAF instant yeast, or if you are stuck with buying it last minute get some of the Red Star yeast packets. SAF is superior (as is instant yeast), but either of those options will provide you with better results than Fleischmann's.",-0.7

Haven't had one since, probably because they seem to be so labor-intensive to make, with all that muddling of the mint leaves, etc.  So, I was curious about the Mojito drink offered by Crystal Light Mocktail line from Kraft foods.  The pitcher of Mojito drink that I whipped up was interesting, though it seemed a little on the weak side.  It was a strange green color, but there was a nice lime and minty flavor, kind of reminiscent of the one I had so long ago!  But the one big downfall for me was that pesky aftertaste of Aspartame!  Unfortunately, I have to watch my calorie/sugar intake now, so I'll be trying to get my tastebuds to accept that terrible aftertaste.

The packaging is attactive, with instructions that are easy to follow for bread machines and conventional ovens.  You get a bag of the flour, a packet of yeast, and two packets of liquid sourdough starter.  I used my Zojirushi bread machine on the whole wheat setting, which usually works great.  Trial number 1: Made exactly according to package directions, the bread came out like an undercooked doughy rock.  While it did rise during the process, the last rise was minimal.  Usually a 1 1/2 pound loaf bakes 7-8"" high in my machine.  This one was barely 4"" high, half of what is should be.  The taste was bitter and the herb flavors, including caraway, coriander, and fennel, were unpleasant.  Trial number 2:  I added an egg and an extra packet of yeast, plus 2 tsp of sugar, in an effort to help the bread rise more.  I also baked it for 10 minutes longer in the regular oven after the bread machine finished so it wouldn't be so doughy.  The result was no better than the first. The loaf was very heavy, bitter and taste, not good at all, inedible. Trial number 3:  This time I combined the package of Seitenbacher with half of a standard white bread recipe that works well in my machine (basic white bread: 1 5/8 cup unbleached white flour, 1/2 cup plus 1 T water, 1 T dry milk powder, 2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 packet of yeast).  I hoped that the combination of a lighter white bread with this dark heavy rye would help.  Well the resulting loaf did rise more, but only to about 7-8"".  This is essentially 1 1/2 time the usual recipe, so it should have risen to the top of the pan, 10-11"" or more.  It's still very heavy, and the additional sugar did nothing to overpower the strong bitter flavor of this bread.  It did taste a little better with a lot of butter on it, but not enough to really enjoy it.  I had to convince myself I liked it, but I didn't.<br /><br />Perhaps this style of bread is supposed to have a bitter flavor, but it's really unique in a negative way, and unlike any rustic sourdough rye I've ever had.  I'll be feeding my three experimental loaves to the birds.  I do wonder if the Seitenbacher German Farmers Bread without seeds would taste better or not, but it might also has the same herbs.",0.86

I will tell you the water somehow tastes different (and better) really cold vs. room temperature.<br /><br />After trying this water myself and being unable to conjure up a ""wow"" factor, in order to see if there is a taste difference with this water I set up a ""Water Challenge"" similar to the old Pepsi Challenge with two of my co-workers as follows: I poured equal amounts of cold water in cups containing the Essentia water, water from a Walmart / Sam's-branded bottle of water, and water from the tap that had gone through a filtration device in the office.  The results were incredible - you couldn't tell a difference and the limited test subjects were unable to correctly identify the ""better"" water.  For clarification, the Walmart-branded bottle was first for one participant and tap water was first for the other.<br /><br />In other words, there is nothing wrong with this water.  However, if you look at the cost/benefit analysis of purchasing this water - including shipping from Amazon - the accountant in me just can't say I need to make sure I buy this in the future: it's way too pricey per ounce when, at the end of the day, there's probably nothing wrong with the water coming out of your tap if you have basic filtration on it.",0.51

The Guatemalan Blend is fantastic too, but it has a slightly heavier chocolate note and a dark acidity that I tend to shy away from (but Starbucks drinkers will like it better).<br /><br />For anyone that has actually been to Costa Rica, and you are searching for that same cup of coffee that you were served at the resort/hotel, this might be it.  I had the occasion (twice) to have to do some work in Costa Rica, and then afterward was frustrated at my attempts to find the similar lovely rich-cocoa taste that I'd had, until now.  This is it.  This is the real MCoy.<br /><br />In my world, only the (Copper Moon) Panama Bouquet Blend might be better, but the Costa Rican Blend is a bit more chocolaty, and has a bit of acidity that lets you know it's coffee and not a hershey bar.  Even though it has SOME acidity, I don't mean that it has anywhere near the kind of acidity that you will find anywhere else on the planet.  This is smooth, and rich, great aroma, chocolate finish.  Only the Panama Bouquet Blend has less bite than the Costa Rican Blend has.<br /><br />I will re-order this myself, because I like it best in the afternoon (I always have morning and afternoon coffee, Panama Bouquet in the AM, and Costa Rican Blend (or Guatemalan when the mood takes me) after lunch).",0.93

When the local groceries stopped stocking Lipton's Loose Leaf Tea. I assumed Lipton had stopped selling it because tea bags were more profitable, and people found it easier to use tea bags. WRONG, we've been sold on the idea of convenience, and taste took the back seat. This tea is packaged in a foil lined package, is fresher tasting and very consistant in quailty. Make it sweet or unsweet, it does not matter. If you make it too strong, just add water, the flavor is there!  You will be amazed as to how many GALLONS of tea you can make with one box.  You will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula. It's worth the time!  I live in an area that has very soft water, so I don't need as much product to brew a gallon. It definitely takes more if you have hard water.<br />This is how I brew mine (this may help you get started). Using a Mr. Coffee,(12 cup) Measure 3 Tablespoons (slightly rounded) and place in the filter (just as you would coffee) Fill you crafte to the max, and brew. For sweet tea, I use One and 1/4 cup sugar per gallon. It's  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher, then add the hot liquid. The sugar will dissolve completely, and you won't need as much sugar. When the sugar has dissolved, add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon. If you are not pleased with the outcome try making some adjustments. Once you figure it out. It becomes routine, and is probably one of the the most economial drinks you can make!<br />ENJOY!!<br /><br />PS I keep mine in the freezer in a ziplock, after I've opened the box.",0.45

Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.

53880,0,7.0,Male,4.0,0,15.0,2.0,5.0,180.05,Hi quality raw sunflower lecithin,"I read about lecithin years ago in an old nutrition book by Adele Davis, and decided to try it. I liked it, or liked the idea of taking it anyway, but stopped taking it when I learned that some health problems I was having at the time were related to soy in my diet. My health improved greatly when I stopped eating soy, but I missed the lecithin.<br /><br />I was happy to discover recently that other types of lecithin were available. One source is sunflowers.  I tried sunflower lecithin capsules, but was less than enthused about them.  Nothing wrong with them, but they felt like an inert food somehow, maybe because of the processing when it's put into the capsules.<br /><br />I found LoveRawFoods Raw Sunflower Lecithin online a few weeks ago and decided to try it. It's a little pricey, not so much the product itself, which is reasonably priced, but when you combine the product price with the shipping, it adds up.  But I'm glad I bought it.  I really love it.  It's great to be able to eat lecithin again after all of these years.<br /><br />To reiterate: sunflower lecithin is not like soy lecithin. Soy lecithin is an industrial waste product marketed for human consumption (made usually from genetically modified soybeans). It's toxic and bad for you.  Sunflower lecithin is a beneficial food product derived from sunflower seeds. And better yet, the LoveRawFoods brand is raw. Very cool.  It tastes like very fresh sunflower seeds.  I'll keep buying it as long as LRF keeps making it.<br /><br />If you're new to lecithin, I'd recommend mixing some into a smoothie, till you develop a taste for it. I actually eat it by the spoonful. But I know that's unusual :)Most people would want to mix it into some food.",0.8

I was excited to try two new salsas from different specialty companies that I would've never been able to try.  They arrived in a sturdy box with foam packing peanuts.  I admit that I was a little nervous that they wouldn't arrive safely, but the glass jars were completely fine.  They were even accompanied by a newsletter giving some background about the salsas and the companies who made them.  They both looked so good, it was hard to decide which one to open first!  My wife and I decided to open the Pink's Mild Salsa from Pennsylvania to accompany our fajitas that we were making for dinner.  It was bold, fresh and made with minimal ingredients and also contained no allergens.  Medically, my wife has to follow a Gluten Free diet, so we are always concerned with allergens and trying to eat foods closer to nature.  A few days later we opened the second salsa (after scraping the first jar dry) and were equally impressed!  The second jar was a Picante Salsa from Hillside Orchard farms in Georgia and was very flavorful and had some visibly large cilantro pieces (my favorite), but was not as chunky as the other one.  This one was great to pour over tacos, as it had more of a sauce consistency, but it was a little harder to pick up with a chip.  Overall, I was very satisfied and I'm looking forward to next month's salsas!  This was the perfect gift for us and would highly recommend the Salsa of the Month Club!",0.99

Yes, these are boxed cookies, not to be confused with homemade, which is the sterling standard for me.  But given that, they're lovely!  The body of the cookie is slightly bean-flavored, since that's what the flour blend relies on; but it's not an obtrusive flavor.  Just a bit tangy.  The milk-free chips are great:  nicely rounded flavor, not burnt or sharp.  The texture is pleasantly crisp & sandy; not tough, not hard, not chewy.  Great with coffee or tea. Our favorite is the chocolate chip variety, but the cinnamon and sugar cookies versions are delicious also.  If you're not allergic yourself, but considering buying some for guests or grandchildren who are, then I'd encourage you to go for it.

Science Diet seemed to be the only likley alternative. My cats liked the different size and texture of the round balls but in their infinite wisdom Frisky (the nitwits) decided there wasn't a market for the product any longer. Fat lot they know. Our three cats don't love this ""dental diet cat food"" as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats.",-0.54

We were given a bag of Science Diet when we brought her home from the shelter and she wouldn't eat that.  My daughter picked up a bag of Iam's puppy food and that's what we were giving her the first month. Her poops smelled so bad from day one when we got her and didn't improve on the Iam's.  She seemed to have consistently runny poops as well.  She was also constantly itchy and scratching at herself.  We switched to Wellness puppy food and after the initial introduction for her to get used to that brand we haven't looked back.  She loves it!  She is now on the adult formula even though she's not quite a year old (read that beagles should be switched over to adult food at about 6 months because they have reached their full height).<br /><br />We are finishing up her second bag on the adult formula and she is looking beautiful, sleek and healthy.  We have so many people comment about how pretty she is and, especially, how soft her fur is. Her poops rarely smell and when they do it is usually because she was given new treats/snacks or one she hasn't had in awhile.<br /><br />I have seen some reviews (mostly from the puppy formula) with people complaining about runny stools but it is important to gradually get your dog used to any new dog food and gradually build up the amount by mixing it with the dog food you are replacing.  We even did this when we switched from the puppy to adult formula even though it probably wasn't as necessary to do that as both were the lamb formulas.<br /><br />She's full of energy and very happy and seems to love her dog food as she always eats it up and sometimes will carry in her bowl looking for seconds!!<br /><br />Also love how fast this company ships out the dog food too!

Each chocolate candy contains a good-sized blueberry swimming in the liquid filling instead of a cherry.<br /><br />I have come to prefer the dark chocolate cherry cordials much more than the milk chocolate ones but these blueberry cordials are only available in milk chocolate so they are definitely very sweet!  They are best with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee or tea to go with them.  I enjoy the combination of the blueberry and chocolate and the liquid filling is fun to eat.  Children also like these if you are willing to share but the drips can be messy for the youngest ones.<br /><br />If you have never read about how they get the liquid center into the candy, it is quite interesting.  When they are made, the filling is solid and it becomes liquid over time because of the invertase, an enzyme that changes the sucrose into glucose and fructose.  Bees also use invertase to make honey from nectar.<br /><br />The 5.6 ounce (159 gram) box contains ten candies, each with 60 calories.

It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change.

54038,0,10.0,Male,4.0,0,22.0,2.0,9.0,163.86,A healthier dessert alternative,"Chocolate flavored granola, with dark chocolate chunks and dried red straweberries and raspberries?  That's what ""Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries"" offers you.  Below are my impressions on this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It's tasty.  I've eaten a fair amount of granola in my life, and flavoring it with chocolate actually makes it seem less granola-like, which is a good thing, if you know what I mean.  The granola has a nice chocolate flavor, not too strong and not too sweet.<br />- It's certified organic.  While I'm admittedly not an ""all natural"" kind of consumer and don't typically shop at organic food stores, I will buy (and pay more for) organic products when given a choice, provided they offer a similar taste.<br />- There are enough dark chocolate chunks to be noticible when you're eating, and they add to the positive experience<br /><br />Cons:<br />- There aren't enough dired red berries. While you can see a few small pieces in the mix, you can't readily taste them.<br />- It's a little high in calories, so portion control is essential if you're going to use this as part of your healthy eating patterns. An 11 1/2 ounce bag contains 10 servings, and each serving has 140 calories, about 40 percent is fat.  One or two servings at a time is fine, the whole bag is not.  :-)<br /><br />Overall, this is a good, tasty treat that is much better for you than cookies or ice cream and the like.  Just be sure to watch how much you eat.  Four starts.",0.95
54039,0,14.0,Male,4.0,0,16.0,12.0,17.0,293.23,Great product but over-priced here,"Today I purchased this product at my local health food store (which, BTW, is not any bargain hunter's dream).  When I tried the dressing, I enjoyed the taste, as well as its nutritive qualities.  Consequently, I came to Amazon hoping to not only find it, but at a more competitive price.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen.  My local store's normal price is $4.99.  Howver, a (regular monthly) 10% off everything sale was happening today. Factor in local sales tax of 5%.  Considering all of that, my final price was still under five dollars.  Compare this to the current Amazon price of $8.99.  Of course I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Earlier comments about a high shipping price for this item seem to no longer apply, because the product is now shipped free with any $25 order--a policy I always look for!  If Amazon could arrange a more competitive price for this item (perhaps by selling it in six-packs???), then I'd consider purchasing this excellent dressing from Amazon.  Please reconfigure your pricing here, Amazon!<br /><br />UPDATE 10.26.10<br />Amazon, since I last wrote, you've reduced the per/bottle price to $5.49.  I'm glad to see you're apparently responsive to feedback!<br />This new price is no steal, but at least it's somewhat comparable to other retailers.  (Yet, I look to Amazon for super bargains, and not so much for ""regular"" prices.)<br />For example, above I referenced a local health food store whose every day price for this product is $4.99/bottle.  For the month of October, however, that same store has this product on sale for $3.99/bottle.  I figure there's sufficient profit margin to permit a month-long temporary mark down like that.<br />Hence, I repeat: Amazon, consider selling this awesome dressing in 4-packs or 6-packs (or any combination which drops the per/bottle price below $5.49).  In view of your staggering sales volumn, it seems kinda likely that you could arrange a price that beats the every day price of my local health store.<br /><br />To anyone who hasn't tried this yet, sample it!  It's a good risk because you'll likely find it to be very flavorful.  It's healthful, also.  I enjoy it so much that I tend to pour it on all kinds of foods now, in addition to salad.

Only about 20 seconds or so on each side, until they bubble and get crispy.  If there are any flat or uncooked areas, microwave them again for another 10 seconds or so.<br /><br />Black pepper style is the best and has a little zip to it, we often eat them with salsa, (like a tortilla-chip).<br />Great with a cold beer.",0.83

Very large (I have a photo at the top).  I usually get more manageable sizes to take with me when I walk/jog - a size that fits in the cup holder of my stroller.  Anyway I thought I'd give this a shot today since I was going for a longer jaunt, a 5 mile combined jog / walk with my stroller and perhaps I'd want more than just one small water bottle.<br /><br />The bottle size actually made it so I drank less because I had to store it in the bottom of the stroller and it wasn't readily available... so I only drank half of it and that was consumed at the end of my outing.  But I sort of felt more energized after drinking it - and I was quite pooped after 5 miles of pushing the stroller.  I don't know if that was psychological because I knew there were electrolytes in it or if there really was more of a boost.<br /><br />I can't comment too much on if the pH is of any benefit or not, I understand you have to drink this for awhile before any benefit kicks in... HOWEVER I did a quick search online to see if I could read anything from an independent source telling me why 9.5 pH or a higher pH in general is good for you and I couldn't find anything EXCEPT websites that were trying to sell me their products.  I couldn't find a website to tell me WHY this was good that WASN'T trying to sell me anything and that had some credibility.  So please keep that in mind.  One of the websites that was trying to sell me their pH stuff sited some ""Japanese study"" but gave no specifics... so I could not even look that study up to verify anything.  So it sort of leaves me to believe the pH thing may be a fad.  Probably a harmless one though.<br /><br />Bottom line... water tasted good.  I like the electrolyte thing.  Don't care much about the pH, think that may be silly.",0.72

From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice caoncentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.<br /><br />As to taste:  I was expecting ""Black Cherry"" in a dark red can to be strong.  This was mellow.  I could taste the cherry juice, but I think apple was the dominant flavor.  This tasted remarkably like a children's juice box or a capri sun baggie, probably because it's a mix of juices in which apple is prominent.  It tasted like real juice - not fake.<br /><br />The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.  At home, purchasing fruit juice in a bottle and seltzer water in a bottle and mixing them in a glass provides more options and a taste of carbonated fruit juice.  I used to do lots of carbonated fruit juice mixes, and think I prefer plain apple juice and seltzer water to this, mostly because the Switch flavor didn't strike me.  Which juice sits best with you will be a matter of taste, and if you like carbonated fruit juice, then this could be a way to make it portable for bag lunches, road trips, and such.<br /><br />Overall, if you drink a lot of sodas and like fruit juice, this is worth a try, perhaps in the form of one can on a road trip.

A few years ago, however, I discovered what would be my favorite use for it...potato salad.<br /><br />I have never liked deli potato salad and am pretty picky about homemade.  My sister-in-law made some for a party, and it was the best I had ever eaten.  I asked her what her secret was, and she ran down the usual list of potato salad ingredients.  Then she told me she added Old Bay Seasoning.  Bingo!  That was it.<br /><br />I went straight home and made my homemade potato salad, grabbed my can of Old Bay, and sprinkled away.  I can't say exactly how much I use, because I never measure ingredients when I'm making my own recipes.  Just add some, stir it up, and taste....add some, stir it up, and taste till you like it.  The seasoning does not overpower the salad flavor at all, just enhances it.  Don't be concerned that there is going to be a crab or shrimp taste to your salad; it isn't the Old Bay that makes crabs and shrimp taste like seafood.  Old Bay just makes seafood taste better, and now potato salad too.  Try it on your homemade potato salad; I think you'll love it.",0.65

They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only ""real"" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.<br /><br />****",0.73

So my advice comes to you as a complete novice.<br /><br />Honestly, I shudder to think what the normal flavor tastes like if this is berry. I do not get that flavor at all! My cousin says she loves mixing a scoop in her yogurt so that is the first way I tried it. It was very gritty and tasted almost like grass clippings. Bleck.<br /><br />Since then I have been making a smoothie with 1 scoop, yogurt, frozen berries, half of a banana, a small squirt of honey, and fruit juice. It tastes very good and is a great start to the day. Only once in awhile do I get a hint of graininess, but it's now tolerable in this form.<br /><br />In the week since I've started this I've noticed a boost in energy. I used to become so worn out I needed to nap every afternoon, which was I was NOT happy about, hence me seeking out energy boosters and my cousin recommending this. I have not napped once since starting Amazing Grass and only layed down one afternoon for a short rest. The other days I was able to remain awake, active, and energized. This surprised me b/c I didn't expect it to be noticeable or work that fast.<br /><br />I have yet to see any skin improvements I read about elsewhere. In fact, I've noticed a slight increase. Perhaps detoxing? Not sure.<br /><br />As another rater mentioned - being regular takes on a whole new meaning w/ this Amazing Grass! I've been using it once a day and my BM have increased, which perhaps is detoxing again and definitely could attest to more energy. Be warned - the first few days you will have some gas so maybe start over a weekend.<br /><br />I hope this will continue to work for me. My only cons so far are the flavor (which I wish were tastier so I didn't have to disguise it so much) and the price. I'm not sure why the berry flavor is $8 more than the other tub? At nearly $40 every two months it's a pretty pricey supplement, but hopefully will be worth it if the positives keep adding up.<br /><br />UPDATE: Have now been on it for a few months and LOVE IT! We left our tub out of state so I went without it for a week and felt horrible. When I reordered a new tub and started up again I felt better again within 2 days. My skin has now evened out, also the regularity has too. Another unexpected and added benefit is my chronic headaches have DISAPPEARED! I used to get 2 or 3 a week and have only had about 3 in 3 months time when the weather is horrible. Have since been able to tolerate it mixed in with fruit juice, even though it is still grainy. If taking regularly I suggest subscribing delivery - now we get ea. 60 day tub for about $32, much cheaper than anywhere else I can find!",-0.56

I always have dry food available which they like but they become vocal to be feed this stuff, they are Siamese so I must do their bidding or the racket doesn't end. I always smell the open product and for six months now, no irregular smells or coloring.<br /><br />Concerns are the fillers that I see in the ingredients, brown rice and oat bran are better than wheat and corn I agree, but it still irks me that a company makes such a commitment to be organic and then uses fillers. Also, Guar Gum makes me a little nervous, though guar gum is one of those fibers that are everywhere, it is basically a thickening agent (think cornstarch) and like any fiber it has its positives along with its negatives. A plus for this brand is that its carried in my local supermarket which is very practical and the price I find reasonable for an organic brand.<br /><br />Since I don't want them to become dependent on any single brand I also feed them Natural Life (same filler issues) which they like but don't love as much as Newman's Turkey flavors.

The one that comes with this product is actually very nice - I haven't used another to compare it to but it was easy to snap the needle on the syringe and use.  It's definitely not a cheapy, one-use item - I have saved mine and will reuse it often!  It was easy to use and worked very well at getting marinade inside the chicken.  As for the marinade itself, my family loved the very real buttery flavor mixed with a ""creole-light"" spice.  I say light because I was honestly expecting it to be a bit spicier or intense, and I would have preferred it that way, but the nice thing about it being a bit lighter was that my 7yr old was able to eat the chicken I made with it.  I used it for chicken breasts, not a whole chicken as the bottle states, but it worked very well - I'll bet it would be delicious on a whole chicken.  And kind of fun to use too!  One tip: if you don't think you'll be using the entire bottle (I didn't) at once, you'll want to pour the marinade into another container to draw it out of with your injector, otherwise you'll be dipping the needle you just had in raw chicken back into the bottle every time you refill it.  I made 4 breasts and used about 1/2 the bottle.",0.99

This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

I've consulted with my Vet, Animal Shelter, and Obedience Trainer who trained dogs in the military for 20 years; ALL agreed that this is a good and safe product BUT like anything else you give you puppy/dog SHOULD be supervised AND timed.  They also all agreed that the limit on giving these chews should be between 10-20 minutes and either taken away for future use, or the remainder thrown away.  If you are a SMART pet owner, you will be supervising the use of this product and if after 10 minutes, the product is beginning to be swallowed, I guess it makes sense to take the product away.  These work exactly for what they are intended, to reduce and remove tarter and plaque.  It is NOT a treat or toy!  As much as it CAN be digested, yes, some dogs will try to swallow too big a bite and begin to choke.  As pet owners, again, supervision is needed.

If the chews aren't too badly mangled, I save for the next/another day, otherwise, they get trashed.  The only other note I will also agree on is the lack of consistency in size/shape of these chews.  Great product otherwise.",0.71

I asked around and looked around, but couldn't find anything on its ingredient list.  Being that it was by far the cheapest option on Amazon for coconut water, I jumped on a case.  It tastes pretty good, but pretty sweet too.  If that's your thing, than you'll love it.  However, I was disappointed by the ingredients list: young coconut juice, water, young coconut pulp, sugar, sodium metabisulphite (for color retention).  It tastes reminiscent of sugar water with a coconut background.  By comparison the Nirvana product I've been buying (pure coconut water) has 15 g of sugar / 16 oz. or about 1 g/oz.  Parrot has 24 g / 11.5 oz. or about 2 g/oz.  In other words, they've doubled the sugar content of an already sweet beverage.  24 g of sugar is still substantially less than a can of pop though at 40-60 g.  So if you're looking for a sweet beverage to replace a can of pop for you or someone else, this could be a good option, but I think the natural coconut water is sweet enough and didn't need alteration.  The addition of sugar water is probably what decreases the price to create such a competitive price.  Nirvana (for example) doesn't have any added preservatives either.  You can learn more about sodium metabisulphite here:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The 16 oz Nirvana (as compared to the 11.5 oz Parrot) has the same calories, 0.5 g more fat, same carbs, 1.7 g protein (0 g for Parrot), 6% calcium (2% for Parrot), 8% vitamin C (15% for Parrot), and 6% iron (4% for Parrot).  The Nirvana product is also more expensive at $2/16 oz can vs. 0.50 cents/11.5 oz can for Parrot.  About 11cents for Nirvana or 4.5cents per oz for Parrot.  So it depends on what is affordable for you.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful!",0.54

What I did smell had that freshly brewed scent but it was subtle. The flavor was very balanced - not bitter like an overly roasted coffee (Sorry Starbucks) but not wishy washy like most grocery store blends. It was the kind of morning coffee that I enjoy, flavor without being too bold and in my face first thing. Not too much acid, but a bit of a zing.

Great when tweaked.,"If you follow the instructions on the back of the package, you will get a pretty good sauce, a little grainy, a little bit sweet, and an ok cheese flavor with just a hint of heat. Definitely better than most nacho cheese sauces you could get in a can. Here's how to turn this into something you'd pay a lot more money for:<br />1. Heat up 6 tablespoons of water in the microwave with 1 tsp of canned diced green chiles for 1 minute.<br />2. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the cheese sauce mix and whisk until the sauce starts to thicken.<br />3. Put 1 slice of American cheese on top, I use a deluxe or deli style, and microwave for 30 seconds.<br />4. Whisk until the cheese blends in. You now have an awesome cheese sauce with only around 130 calories.<br /><br />Prepared like this, the cheese sauce is excellent over a baked potato or as a dip for tortilla chips. Heck, I could eat it with a spoon. I deducted 1 star because I really feel that this cheese sauce needs the diced green chiles and the American cheese in order to be a 5 star sauce. I probably wouldn't use it often by itself, but with my modifications, it really is delicious and not too high in calories. Plus my modifications don't add much to the price. A can of diced green chiles will set you back a buck and deluxe American cheese is usually $3.50 for a pack of 24 slices.",0.8

Mango is one of those weird fruits like rhubarb (veg?) that aren't great on their own but make everything else taste like heaven. Ever try strawberry-rhubarb pie? Run to your local Marie Callendar's and order a piece of strawberry and a piece of strawberry-rhubarb (without whipped cream, please). Suddenly you're in a different world. Even my sister-in-law who never likes anything I make, finally gave in on the strawberry-rhubarb pie. Well, mango has the same effect. Once you get used to it, you'll wonder how you ever lived life without it.<br /><br />NOTE: Do NOT order the ""Light"" version. All they did was put in half the amount of juice and half the amount of water. Yuck.<br /><br />Bottom line: see if you can get a small bottle or a taste sometime. But give it a couple of tries. If it doesn't work out, such is life. But don't forget to try the strawberry-rhubarb pie or cobbler.<br /><br />On the other hand, V8, which I have always liked, declares that their Fusion drinks contain one full serving of vegetables and one full serving of fruit for each 8 oz serving.

54397,1,1.0,Female,3.0,0,21.0,2.0,8.0,152.07,Read it once. Read it twice. Reading Chicken Soup With Rice,"These days, when a person says, ""chicken soup"" they're probably going to follow up those words with, ""for the soul"" or maybe ""for the teenaged soul"".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, ""chicken soup"" those words were followed by an enthusiastic ""with rice!"".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale ""Pierre"" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as ""a baubled bangled Christmas tree"".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing ""Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice"" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.<br /><br />I take my ""Chicken Soup With Rice"" readings seriously.  This book was the ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest.",0.83

I had a couple hours of jujitsu training that day, and I was in desperate need of a wake-up. I walked a couple miles home and on my way, I stopped and grabbed a 5-hour energy. I took it at 3:30, and by 4:45 (when training class started) I felt great. I went through the 2 hours of training just fine, but what really surprised me was that I still had a TON of energy after that. I really felt the need to burn that energy, so at 7:30 I decided to go for a run.<br />A while later, I realized that I just run 5 miles.<br />The energy wasn't an intense sugar high either. It just felt like I could run and never stop.

I soaked the pasta for a minute (or 3) and it didn't really seem to soften it any but I'm sure it must have helped.  Then, based on the recipes provided, I put it in a large skillet with some Asian and basalmic oil and stirred it around.  It wasn't softening as quickly I I thought so I added a little water and put a lid on it for just a minute.  Perfect!  It came out soft and had absorbed the flavors beautifully.

I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings.

The flavor has developed and the starter become more active the longer I have worked with it.  This morning I found my overnight rise spilling over into the (cool) oven where I had it rising.  I had no idea how long it took to make a loaf of sourdough bread; almost 16 hour using the provided receipe.  It did produce an excellent batch of sourdough pancakes, but still a long process.  Keep trying!<br /><br />The product says free shipping, but for some reason I paid more for shipping ($4.49) than I did for the starter ($2.99).  The product arrived in a standard business envelope with about two ounces of dry starter.  I used about half (as per instructions) to create my starter.  The instructions are primative and poorly formatted for use in the kicthen.  The ad says you get a 12 page booklet, I got 3 - 8.5 X 11 single sided pages.

I have another that has the treat out in 5 minutes and has the little treats out in about an hour (he then waits for the other dog to give up, then finishes that off too).  The blue silicone part is the toy they have had the longest and seems to still be lasting.  I have had it over 6 months.  I have the red fire hydrant one also and it is almost torn up and I have had it less time than this.

I would be interested to know if it outlasted most other toys given to them.  I am not saying it will work for sure for your dog, but I do say it is worth a try, as I considered my dogs hopeless (they tore up everyting in 5 minutes or less) before I found this.<br /><br />It has come to my attention that if you moisten the edges the treat pops in easier (great to know because I was using a spoon to wedge it in).  Just make sure you let it dry before giving it to them so it is more difficult for your dog to get out and (love this tip) put the treat in upside down so the dome is facing inwards and the treat will last longer because it is more difficult for your doggie to get at.",0.45

Point is, I bought it and was immediately brought back to my childhood days when my dad would buy this for my brother and I. I loooooooove this cereal, it is by far the best and well worth the money. Can't beat the price, can't beat the taste. Tastes just as I remembered years ago. Definitely a great buy for the cereal lovers in a family.

He is a serious chewer and pretty much got that small portion down to a piece that could fit in the palm of your hand, with bits of bone laying everywhere.  Obviously, he ate most of the pieces and 2 days later was throwing up.

54590,0,20.0,Male,3.0,0,16.0,2.0,2.0,303.61,"Get educated, save $","Even at $6 per canister, this product is inexplicably overpriced. Let me explain why:<br /><br />Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following:<br /><br />  -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces<br />  -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller<br />  -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled<br />  -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal<br />  -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening<br />  agent.<br /><br />This product fits into the first catagory.  Their claim of ""guaranteed uniformity"" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic.<br /><br />All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth.  Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove.<br />Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. ""chi"").<br /><br />I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either.<br /><br />Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the ""Rolls Royce"" of oats, there is a brand called ""Really Raw Oats"". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat).  How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless.<br /><br />The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks.<br /><br />p.s.  the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS! Haven't seen them, however, since the mid 1990's.

54595,0,5.0,Male,3.0,0,26.0,2.0,9.0,231.48,Delicious and Nutritious,"From all I have ever been able to learn, Lundberg is a first class operation.  I have tried (I think) every rice and rice blend that they offer, over the years that I have been buying their products.  While I didn't always care for a particular variety, it was never an issue of quality, just a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />There is one problem, which is not Lundberg's fault, but is worth noting.  Too often, in local grocery stores, the Lundberg product does not turn over fast enough to avoid a decline in quality.  I assume it is caused by a fermentation of the whole grain (not a problem with lesser rices because much of the ""good stuff"" is removed).  The symptoms are a bag which is swollen, and rice which tastes a bit like Play-Doh smells.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V64HZ2"">Play-Doh 24 Pack of Colors</a>  In order to avoid this problem, I started ordering my Lundberg on-line, and storing the extra bags in my freezer or refrigerator until used.  So, buying it here (which is a little cheaper than Lundberg's on-line store) is a good way to go.  If you want to buy just one bag to try at your local grocery store, check the bag carefully, and if it tastes like Play-Doh when you get home with it, that bag was too old.<br /><br />Of all the Lundberg products, Countrywild is my absolute favorite.  It is a nice blend of flavors, and I sometimes eat a bowl of it for my entire meal.  It has a good flavor to it, but it is not as intense as some of the other varieties.<br /><br />One more thing.  For years I was frustrated with obtaining a good result when cooking whole grain rice.  I finally tried a pressure rice cooker instead of the more common non-pressure methods.  It really made a huge difference, and if you are a rice lover, you may want to try something like this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SNWJ3A"">Sanyo ECJ-PX50S 5-Cup Micro-Computerized Pressure Rice Cooker and Steamer</a> or if your budget can stand it, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZZGW"">Zojirushi NP-HTC18 Induction Heating 10-Cup Pressure Rice Cooker and Warmer</a><br /><br />(I use the Sanyo and like it pretty well.  A search on ""pressure rice cooker"" here, or a visit to any large Asian store, will reveal other makes and models, but there are no inexpensive pressure type rice cookers because of the substantial construction and safety requirements.)",-0.64

I ordered these last Christmas to include in little gift packages... Ive ordered them before from amazon and had no problem, though this time they came in an opened box and with the expiration code on the bottom of the tin rubbed/blotted out. On some of the packages I could still faintly make out a date from early 2010 though. By no means did I want to give as gifts expired candy, let alone boxes that had been tampered with. I called amazon and they promptly replaced the case, though unfortunately the new case was expired as well(despite me asking for them to check), though the dates had not been rubbed out. At this point, I knew that the entire batch was just probably old and took my chances and asked them to replace with a different flavor(as I knew they would not check), hoping the new flavor was from a different shipment. Luckily, the mango ones I ordered were fine and did not expire until 2012. It was just terribly unfortunate that such a great item had no checks or balances before they left the amazon warehouse- ultimately amazon replaced both boxes, but it was a hassle and disappointment to keep getting old merchandise.",0.88

The recipe came from Season #1 of ""Good Eats"", Churn Baby Churn.  2 cups of half & half, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup sugar, a little pure fruit pectan, and one of these beans.  Heat the cream to 170 degrees, mix in your other ingredients well, then kill the heat.  You now have ""ice cream batter"".  Pour the batter in a sealed container, and place the container in the Frig for 6 hours.  After 6 hours, get out your ice cream maker and churn for about 30-35 minutes.  I find longer is better.<br /><br />Alton Brown put up a little notification prior to a commercial break stating that Madagascar beans are the most sought-after despite the fact that the Mexican beans are more flavorful. Regrettably, the only source of vanilla beans in my hood is Williams-Sonoma, and they only carry the Madagascar beans.  Those do make for a delicious vanilla ice cream, but I didn't want to pass on the opportunity for more flavor.  I decided to test Alton's claim by ordering some these beans.<br /><br />The results are pretty sensational.  I pretty much mopped up the floor with some house guests last.  They loved the beef bourguignon and the Paella I made, but the vanilla ice cream afterward knocked 'em dead.  Let's just say they were flabbergasted.<br /><br />Make some vanilla ice cream.  You will like the results.<br /><br />Is Alton correct about Mexican v Madagascar beans?  I don't know about that.  I think the Mexican bean is the far more familiar flavor.  If you are an American, you grew up on the flavor of the Mexican vanilla beans.  This flavor has the home field advantage.  The Madagascar bean is more exotic.  It has a coffee-vanilla kind of flavor.  I like them both.  I think I will cut half a Madagascar and half a Mexican bean on my next batch, and see what the combined flavor is like.",0.84

They are a hard apple flavor sucker with caramel spread on top.  I would not really compare them to a caramel apple because with those, you get apple, caramel and peanuts in each bite.  With these, you get caramel and then the apple flavor.<br /><br />A couple things to keep in mind.  These are suckers you have to lick.  There's no chewing these and there's no putting them in your mouth and letting them melt.  If you leave them in your mouth for even a moment, the caramel sticks to your teeth and feels like it's going to pull out your fillings when you go to remove it.  The sucker will last longer than one you can chew, but you do have to work on the lollipop.  This isn't something you can enjoy while doing cross-stitch, for example.  You need one hand free to hold the stick at all times.<br /><br />Another thing - as you get down to the last little bit of sucker, it becomes sharp on the edges, so I would not advise giving these to children.  Lastly, because you do have to lick these from beginning to end, you are working on it for a while.  So the paper stick starts to fall apart right at the end.<br /><br />These small things aside, I would absolutely recommend these unusual but tasty suckers.  I certainly plan to buy more.",0.49

He tried this about 2 weeks ago and I wanted to wait some time to review it just to make sure.  He said he really loves this stuff.  He said he no longer has dry, flaky scalp and he also said this rinses out nicely.<br />So, of course, I had to try it and it's true.  This stuff is great.

There are definitely some considerations though.<br /><br />First of all, make sure you are getting the proper oil for your needs and recipes.  I only got this light olive oil because it was called for by a recipe I had to make a lot of.  Nine times out of ten I very much prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHPNI0"">Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Super Value Size, 51-Ounce Bottle</a>.  This light one doesn't have nearly as much flavor, especially for salads or simple recipes where you are really tasting the oil.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that olive oil is generally more healthy than other oils.<br /><br />The other thing to keep in mind is the price.  This is one of those products where it really pays to subscribe.

54646,0,1.0,Female,4.0,0,13.0,2.0,4.0,146.87,Enough to stand out among a sea of nutrition bars?,"It seems like another new type of nutrition bar, energy bar, or diet bar pops up every week.  I can't even count the number of brands, let alone varieties.  A lot of them are loaded with sugar, and in many cases you might be better off just eating an apple or a banana and a handful of nuts, but they are really convenient to have around.  They keep for a long time, have interesting and varied flavors, and are certainly much better for you than most any candy bar.<br /><br />To compete in such a crowded market, these products need some sort of differentiator to set them apart from the crowd.  In the case of ""Eat. Think. Smile."" from Apure foods (a Colorado subsidiary of Hershey's) it's the Cocoa Lavado, which they claim has much higher levels of antioxidants in comparison to common Dutch processed cocoa.  Such flavonoids might be good for your heart and circulatory system and could potentially even lower cancer risk a tiny bit.<br /><br />There have been at least a couple of studies indicating there may well be health benefits to lavado ""washed"" cocoa, including one last year from Pennsylvania State University that showed the higher levels of polyphenols in this type of cocoa appear to help block carbohydrates and fats, potentially helping manage weight.<br /><br />I was curious how much of this cocoa is in each bar, in comparison to how much would be needed for any health benefits to be fully realized.  A Hershey study cited by Eat. Think. Smile. seemed to indicate that consuming 22g of natural cocoa was found to cause a measureable improvement in blood vessel health, but I couldn't easily find how many grams of cocoa these bars actually contain.  I'll have to assume for now that they contain at least enough to provide some potential benefit.<br /><br />So, is it enough?  I had to also evaluate the taste, price, and other factors to help find out.<br />At over a dollar per bar, these certainly aren't cheap, but also not out of line with other nutrition bars on the market.  I don't know how much it costs to make one of these or a PowerBar or Cliff Bar, etc, but I suspect they must be rather profitable, as evidenced by the crowded market, and yet still fairly steady prices.  I must be in the wrong line of work.<br /><br />As for ingredients and nutrition, these certainly aren't for the allergy-prone, as they contain nuts, milk, wheat, corn, and eggs.  As long as that's not a problem, they seem reasonably balanced from a nutritional perspective with mostly natural ingredients, including the cocoa, and without a bunch of extra vitamins artificially crammed in for show.  They have 200 calories, 4g protein, and 6g of fiber, much of it from chicory root extract (for comparison Fiber One bars, which are a little smaller, have about 140 calories, 2g protein, and 9g of fiber).<br /><br />I found the Dark Cherry flavor nutrition bars to have a nice flavor, fairly sweet, but not overpoweringly so, with a somewhat light and vaguely cakelike texture (at least in comparison to heavy protein and sports nutrition bars).  The cherry bits, nuts, and oats seemed well balanced without overpowering the cocoa flavor, and as nutrition bars go, these tasted pretty good.<br /><br />Would I buy more?  Probably, if they go on sale.  I do like them better than some other bars, and I also like the idea of the natural, minimally processed cocoa, but I still think the whole product category is overpriced so I tend to either look for good deals, or I find alternate snacks (for example the aforementioned fresh fruit and nuts).  It's hard to beat the convenience of bars you can just drop in a backpack or desk or locker for when you need them though, and these seem as good as most and better than many.",0.91

I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking.  It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't.  With the sweetness of the fig,  a bit more acidity would have balanced it out.  I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable.  I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help.  It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months.  I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain.  I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste.  Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store.

These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.",0.52

I cooked two with that amount of batter. (One large pancake is plenty for most people, I struggled to finish the last few bites, only because there was a lot of it.) I used minimal maple syrup, the real stuff from Canada, and cut up three Calimyrna Figs and placed on top that I also just bought here, and they were absolutely fantastic.

When our 10-month-old son first started going on solid foods, my wife spotted these ""cheese puff"" things in our local grocery store. Our boy instantly loved them. We now use them in a variety of situations. We have a container in the baby's room and another in his stroller and in the car. They all work in much the same way. Whenever the boy gets cranky, we show him the container and it immediately grabs his attention. He gets real excited when we open it and hold out a crunchy. It almost always stops the whining immediately. Amazing! We've even had him in the grocery store and he got real excited when he spotted them on the shelf. That time we had to buy the puffs just to get through the rest of our shopping.<br /><br />In any case, the Lil' Crunchies resemble Cheese Puffs for adults, but have a much milder flavor. They seem to dissolve in the mouth and have presented no choking difficulties as long as we wait for the first to be gone before giving the boy a second. Now that he's teething, he likes to attempt to chew them up. The Crunchies are available in several flavors, but the boy likes the cheese the best.

The texture is different, a little lighter than a chip which may be a positive for some people. You definitely get the chili nacho cheese flavor from it and in my opinion it's about the closest you're going to get to a ""real"" chip if you're looking for low carb. Haven't tried the other flavors though.<br /><br />Size: The bags are small, yes, but not that much smaller than a regular small sized bag of chips. You might find yourself eating more than one bag as a snack though.<br /><br />Price: Pretty good when you buy the bulk (12 pack) product although it works out to about a dollar a bag which IS a little pricey I guess but when you look at it as ""12 dollars for a pack of 12"" somehow, to me, it seems like a better deal. Also, if you like them, sign up for the regular deliveries and it shaves 2 dollars off each order AND includes free shipping so you really can't beat that. Considering the high price of a lot of speciality products (and this is) it's pretty inexpensive.<br /><br />Overall: A good purchase for low carb dieters, a tasty chip substitute, something even fans of traditional chips may enjoy.

Tea isn't a beverage for me, it's an event, starting from boiling the water to when the last drop vanishes down my oesophagus.<br /><br />And as a snob, I don't buy bagged teas, I buy loose leaf. So I normally wouldn't have drank this tea, except that I filched a couple of complimentary bags while waiting interminably at the local dealership (OK, I drank one at the dealership and stole 3, one for each hour I was kept waiting).<br /><br />On the matter of taste, I find it very good. The Bigelow EG appeared to be very strong in color and taste.<br /><br />Tea bag teas are usually cut very fine so the tea bags can be packed flat, and because finely cut leaves have more surface area than big leaves, you don't need to steep the tea as long. In fact the instructions say to steep only 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual 3-4 mins.<br /><br />To me, Earl Grey taste has two components, the tea taste and the bergamot taste, and it takes a lot of skill to blend and make a tea that has a pleasing combination of the two tastes.<br /><br />Taylors and Harrogate has a mild tea and bergamot taste. Whole Foods loose leaf has a strong bergamot taste. Your run of the mill EG usually has a strong tea taste that overshadows the bergamot and you don't taste it at all. Bigelow has a very strong tea taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the bergamot, which you taste at the end. So I like it very much, because I've never had a strong tea that didn't overwhelm the bergamot. And it's definitely not a mild tea, it's very robust and strong. It's not a light handshake, it's a full body hug and kisses on both cheeks when you drink this.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want a very strongly flavored Earl Grey with a strong tea taste, but also a strong hint of bergamot, this is it, I'll definitely buy some (because I think they have security cameras in the waiting area).",-0.55

Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said ""I don't like these, they taste funny.

Despite what O'Reilly used as a tip at the end of his show, gluten-free usually mean more ""carbs"" for a similar serving.<br /> But as a Celiac, varity is truly the spice of life. Celiacs first response to diagnosis is to see all the walls between them and what used to be their favorite foods. Celiacs in this day and age are so much luckier than previous generations. Firstly, because Doctors are running the proper blood tests to diagnosis gluten-intolerance much more frequently. It might appear as if more folks are stricken with this these days, but I am convinced that is just because of this increased knowlegde by the Doctors.<br /> As to these pretzels. They may or may not strike you as better than your previous favorite, but you now understand that the previous favorite were the cause of ""palor"", malnutrision and gastro issues. So you must resign yourself to exploring the every expanding gluten-free offerings.<br /> These are not your Philly soft pretzels, but they make a great salty and crunchy ""chip"" with which to scoop up some hummus, peanutbutter, etc.<br /> Also, this size bag and the Amazon price for a box of these every month or two is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy these healthful snacks. They also good straight from the bag, but it easy to get carried away.<br /> My wife and I found out about my Celiac 5 years ago.

The texture is soft in a way that is very difficult to describe but is unlike any other gummy I have tried, and makes them taste fresh as the day they were made. The flavor is wonderful. You can really tell that they are made with real fruit juice and cane sugar instead of corn syrup. They really do just taste better than other gummy snacks. Now, I'm no healthy eating superstar. We usually can't afford organics (though for some things we try) and we certainly eat our fair share of HFCS (though again, we try to avoid it when we have the option).

An odd thing about this drink mix is the variation in flavor depending on how much water you add to the mix. You have to go pretty light on the water if you want it to taste at all like tea, but that makes the saccharine taste a little too strong. Heavier on the water makes it taste like Kool-Aid.

And maybe the two just don't go together that easily? i.e. if they toss in peanut butter, they'll need to modify the base at least somewhat to make things taste ok at the end?  Or maybe all the peanut butter gets washed away when milk is added?  Regardless of the reason, the cereal just didn't work.

I just discovered this about a week ago when looking for something to lighten up my current blend of Sam's Members Mark medium roast, Caribou Kenya and Caribou La Minita (Peaberry).  I inadvertently forgot myself and add way too much of the MM, so I bought this, round up about 1/3 C. of beans and added it to my stunningly strong mistaken blend.  WOW!!! It suddenly took on that lightly robust flavor I so love.  And YUMM is an understatement.  It is Art to drink!  In the Fall, I add Amy's blend to my mix, usually only adding about 1- 15. Cups of the Sam's MM to a blend of the other two or three<br />flavors.  Now I am back on track.  I HIGHLY recommend this if you are not a fan of ""stand a spoon in the cup"" coffee.<br /><br />My recipe:<br />In a tall storage container with good seal put:<br />1/2-3/4 bags each of Caribou Kenya, Peaberry (La Minita) and, if available Amy's Blend, HOWEVER, the Kenya and Peaberry are the most readily available - Be sure to buy enough to carry you for several months).<br />Add 1 C. Sam's Member's Mark<br />&<br />1/2 bag of Caribou Coffee Daybreak Blend.<br /><br />Close lid securely and then turn container about to mix the beans.  Store in the refrigerator.<br /><br />To grind, only grind about 1/2 C. mixed beans at a time and store ground mix in refrig in another securely closed container.<br />YUMMM!!!<br /><br />PS:<br /> This is a VERY Good price!

55024,0,7.0,Male,4.0,0,14.0,2.0,5.0,161.0,Gold standard...Years of research on my part...,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.",0.82

55030,0,20.0,Male,3.0,0,16.0,2.0,4.0,315.81,Good Flavor & No Salt...Center Spine Section w/Skin & Bones,"I've never had canned salmon with no salt added before.  It is not bad, but it is different.  You can definitely taste the salmon, but in truth, I've had canned salmon numerous times before that had salt in it and it tasted like salmon, too.  The drawback on this particular canned salmon is that it does look like cat food.  If you remove the bones, any large pieces of fish are now in much smaller pieces.  This may work for you, but it isn't exactly what I've become used to with skinless and boneless versions.  The really strong argument for this product is that this is wild-caught Alaskan salmon at a good price.  Plus, if you need a no salt added version or the ability to control the level of salt with self-seasoning, this will definitely work.<br /><br />I have considered buying the skinless and boneless version that Crown Prince puts out, but I have some reservations.  First off is the cost.  You pay more for cans that weigh less (though, maybe the 1.5 ounce weight difference is negated if you remove the bones and skin?).  Second, one reviewer said that the first can was so salty that the remaining eleven cans were going to be donated.  That is a pretty negative reaction, but three other reviewers gave the skinless and boneless version a full five stars.  Finally, the omega-3 seems to be less in the skinless and boneless version, too.  1.5g in the no salt version compared to 0.235g in the skinless and boneless version.  Though, if you end up picking out the skin and bones, doesn't that lower the omega-3 you are consuming?  So, perhaps that is a wash, too.  I guess I'm still not sure.  I may end up going to the skinless and boneless version, but for now, I'll keep up with this one when it comes to my Subscribe & Save.",-0.51

I'm not a coffee drinking expert, but I can definitely tell you this coffee tastes great. I usually prefer my local Kona blend or Italian and French roasts for their stronger flavor, but the Marley Coffee is mild but tastes good. I wouldn't say it is coffee flavored water, but it isn't very strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, I'm not a fan of single-serve pods due to the higher cost.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",0.45

I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.

(For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??

Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.

I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do.

I put it on watermelon and I used to put it in my cup of vanilla ice cream.  This was in 1970 before peanut butter and ice cream was an actual flavor at ice cream parlors.  I should have patented it at that time, but what did a 10 year old girl know?<br /><br />As I got older my love for peanut butter grew and I continued to put it on all kinds of things and of course, peanut butter sandwiches.  Sometimes with jelly, sometimes with marshmallow fluff and frequently just plain peanut butter on bread!  To this day, it is still one of my favorites.  Because peanut butter is so fattening, I hardly ever eat it.....until, I discovered PB2.  Oh my goodness, what an awesome, awesome discovery.  Peanut Butter with a fraction of the calories and all of the taste.<br /><br />PB2 is dehydrated peanut butter where the fat has been squeezed out of the peanuts so what is left is pure protein, no guilt goodness!  I'm always dieting and watching my weight and PB2 has made it so much easier.  There are so many ways to eat this PB2.  I add a teaspoon to protein drinks in the morning.  I rehydrate it with water and dip carrots, apples and watermelon in it.  I mix jelly directly into the PB2 and put in inside a whole wheat tortilla and roll it up.  If you like Pad Tai, make some noodles, shred some carrots and other vegetables and toss some PB2 in and you have a nice Pad Thai.<br /><br />When mixed with water, the texture is very similar to smooth peanut butter, but a bit drier because the oil has been removed.  The taste is pure peanut.  A drop of honey can easily be added for a sweet touch.<br /><br />PB2 is easy to travel with and I always have some with me when I leave home as I like to have healthy snacks when the urge hits.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this peanut butter for anyone who loves peanut butter and is watching their weight.  With PB2, you can have your cake and eat it too!",0.81

Golden Retriever who has some weight issues and Boston, a 35 lib mixed breed who has some dental issues.  I offered the treats, both testers took them readily.  Boston retired to a comfortable spot and began to chew quite eagerly.  Hunter took the entire stick into his mouth which caused me some concern that he would choke on it.  I ordered him to drop the stick, which luckily he did.  I gave him back the stick but held on to one end so he could not take the whole thing in his mouth again. I kept hold of the (now slimy) stick until Hunter chewed off a couple appropriate size chunks.  Once the pieces were a safer size I let him enjoy, which he definitely did.  Boston, meanwhile, was holding the stick between his paws and chewing on it, taking off bite size pieces.  I had no concerns about how he was managing the product.  Both dogs were quite interesting in repeating the test.<br /><br />I offered the product again the following day.  Both dogs were quite eager.  Again Boston had no problem managing the product in a safe manner.  I gave Hunter the stick but retained control of one end so he could not gulp it whole.  He began to chew off a piece, and did eat the product safely.  I inspected Boston's teeth after he finished his portion and was pleased that there seemed to be some lessening in the tarter buildup on the back teeth.<br /><br />Both of my dogs liked the product, although to be fair neither is very picky.  I also offered the product to two other dogs, a 50 lib mixed breed who managed it quite readily and a 10 lb Yorkie who chewed it a bit and then buried it.  I am concerned that a larger, greedy dog like Hunter could choke on this.<br /><br />I like that the product is low calorie but I think that at nearly a dollar a stick it is a bit pricey.

I wanted to taste this because it seemed to be a good combination of juice and carbonated drink.<br /><br />Because refrigeration reduces flavor, I poured the Black Cherry Switch over ice. Another adult and I split the can, to get two different responses. We both agreed the black cherry flavor is rich and true. There is an initial vegetal smell when you pour and then smell the drink. This is actually a good thing. It smells ""real"" and pleasant. Carbonated drinks often smell chemical.<br /><br />You can tell it's black cherry even with your eyes closed. (Many flavored drinks depend on color to inform your taste.) The color is pale red, which looks natural. The can says ""no artificial colors, no preservatives, no sugar added, no corn syrup, gluten free.""<br /><br />The ingredient list includes apple, grape and cherry concentrates. You can taste the apple, and it is pleasant. Neither one of us could taste the grape concentrate.<br /><br />The carbonation is soft, which means the bubbles are medium-sized and don't cause burping. I am a big fan of soft carbonation, as it doesn't make you feel bloated. The other adult who tried the drink does prefer hard carbonation, but enjoyed this because it tasted more like a juice drink.<br /><br />There is a nice smooth mouth feel, and no after taste. The drink tastes clean, not too sweet, and refreshing. The can contains 8.3 oz of liquid and as 130 calories, and 33 g of sugars, for a total carb. content of 35g.<br /><br />In comparison, a 8-oz. can of Coke has 105 calories; 8-oz. of Tree Top apple juice has 120 calories.

I often feel that people are knowingly tricked by the industry by product names which resemble the ""real product"", the best example would be olive oil.<br /><br />Happy of at least finding one of my favorite pasta brands (""deCecco""), I was looking for the San Marzano tomatoes which I was used to get at my local italian grocery store for 1.50 Euros (about 1.80 USD) a can (the acidity of most american canned tomatoes is too high, in my opinion).<br /><br />So far, I have only found this brand at the local grocery stores, and after reading the label, I was very suspicious about it - a San Marzano tomato, produced in USA ? I gave it a chance anyways, at last, they have a high price and they are still on the market, so they might have something going for them.<br /><br />After opening the can, I instantly saw that these can not be real San Marzano tomatoes - San Marzanos are long and thin and bittersweet (once you tried them, you will be able to tell), these are spherical and sweet and sour.<br /><br />I have used them in soup and pasta sauces so far, at least they seem to be a little better than the regular canned tomatoes in the grocery store, but it can not justify the price tag - in Europe I can get this quality for about a dollar.<br /><br />So if you are searching for a good canned tomato, keep on searching - these here might not taste all that bad, but they are not San Marzanos and they are expensive as well.",0.37

This rice simply seems brown - but does not have any fibre (0 g of fibre on the nutrient composition label). This is no fault of the company as they do not advertise it as whole grain rice - but when you read other reviews you think it may be.  I really wish Amazon would post the nutrient profile of the food items they sell like many grocery stores do so you know what it is before the item arrives. Lundberg has a variety of whole grain rices for a similar price and are really tasty (although they take longer to cook because they are whole grain) they have about 3 g of fibre per serving according to the nutrition label.,-0.48

I had never even seen, much less heard of candy melts prior to this undertaking.  Of course, where do I go first when looking for something? Amazon.com!  Now...I live in Texas and it's H-O-T right now, so I was concerned about product ""meltage"" during shipping. I drove myself on over to Michael's and purchased a plethora of Wilton Candy Melts. Well, I couldn't help myself...based on the positive reviews of the Mercken's Candy coatings, I decided to go ahead and order some White (5 lbs) and Blue (1 lb.) Candy Coating.  To my surprise, both arrived without melting...shocker!  A few days later, I ordered Yellow Mercken's (1 lb.) and Paramount crystals, along with a couple other items.  This shipment came and the candy melts had, well, melted! The Paramount Crystals were also a melted mess, but I figured since it was going to be liquified anyway...no harm no foul (or is it ""fowl'?).  I wasn't surprised by this...have you ever BEEN to Texas in late June? As my late Grandmother would say ""It's as hot as Corn Liquor!"" (not that she knew how hot that was, since she NEVER drank alcohol in her 94 years!) So, I will not remove a single star from my rating based on this product melting...after all, it is INTENDED to melt! ***take note you star-removers, you know who you are, you're the people who rate a PRODUCT based on the shipper or other acts of God which have nothing to do with the actual worthiness of the product itself. Rant over.<br /><br />Okay...now that I got the ""back-story"" out of the way...the actual review!  I set about making some chocolate (inside) cake balls along with some cheesecake balls, which were oh-so-yummy, but a big, fat, time-consuming pain. Once again, I digress. I also was going to be dipping pretzel rods and Oreos...a regular ""dip-fest"" as it were.  Being one to experiment until I find the best/easiest...I melted some white almond bark (had used in the past for white and choc dipped pretzels with good success), Wilton's Candy Melts, Ghirardelli White Chocolate (the bars for baking $$$$$), and finally the Mercken's Candy Melts.  Of the 4, the Mercken's was the ""winner"" as far as ease of dipping, smooth consistency and taste.  I hesitate to put taste in there, because it's so subjective and besides, they all tasted good to me. But, I do realize taste is an important consideration for most people. Really, the Ghirardelli had the best taste, but the cost and the difficulty in it ""setting up"" as nicely gave the edge to Mercken's for this project. The Mercken's did edge out the Wilton candy melts as far as MY taste buds go. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Basically, if you're particular, like I am, and the extra cost doesn't bother you, go with the Mercken's .  If this is a project with and for the kiddos, the Wilton melts will be hunky dory. It's not that Mercken's is head and shoulders above Wilton's candy melts, just moderately so. Wilton's are certainly more widely available, cost less and come in more colors.<br /><br />Bottom line (for me) is that Mercken's was easiest to work with and that was the biggest factor in my preference.  With the sprinkles and candy coating...all the desserts were so uber-RICH and sugary, I rightly figured the cake-pops and such wouldn't get eaten as much as they would be looked at for their decorating value and cuteness factor. My soiree hosted no kids...just a a house full of (thirsty) adults who were more focused on the offerings of adult beverages and jello shots than they were the desserts.",0.58

They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.

After the scent of the treats lured him in, he began to play.  It took little time for him to realize that the rope was what was getting in the way of the treating plopping out, so he just set about chewing on the rope until he succeeded in chewing it in half.  After this happened, the shorter knotted end fell into the jug, and the treats came out easily.  Now I am left with an -a-Jug, as the ""tug"" is missing.  We left the remaining 1/2 of the rope in the jug so that there would be some resistance to the treats just falling out.  A tennis balls works well too.

Robert De Niro has ""Taxi Driver."" Marlon Brando had a lot of them, including ""On the Waterfront,"" ""The Godfather,"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" Who can watch Jimmy Stewart and not think of ""It's a Wonderful Life""? See what I mean? The list could on and on indefinitely. The lesser known actors, while not as visible to the majority of moviegoers, are critical to the success of Hollywood because they often take supporting roles that make the leads look good. They are recognizable faces to niche film fans, however. Enter Clint Howard, brother of the better known director and actor Ron Howard. Horror movie fans will forever pay homage to Clint--he of the perpetually balding pate, goofy visage, and lumbering gait--for his seminal role of Stanley Coopersmith in the 1982 gorefest ""Evilspeak."" They will just as likely hold a grudge against him for appearing in Uwe Boll's atrocious ""House of the Dead,"" but that's another story for another time. Clint has appeared in dozens of films, as well as most of the films lensed by his brother, but ""Evilspeak"" is his defining moment.<br /><br />""Evilspeak"" opens in the distant past by showing a group of Spaniards excommunicating Esteban (Richard Moll) and his followers from the Church for blasphemous activities. What sorts of activities? The movie doesn't spend much time explaining what these folks are doing, but we do see Esteban performing some sort of bizarre ritual on the beach immediately before sacrificing a young lady to his dark deities. Flash forward to the present--meaning 1981 or 1982--to a soccer game at the West Andover Military Academy. Stanley Coopersmith (Howard) trips at a critical moment and loses the game for the team. The abuse heaped upon this poor lad is extreme. Coach (Claude Earl Jones) initially sticks up for Coopersmith by telling his teammates that every boy at the academy gets a shot at playing for the school. Within seconds of this exclamation, the coach helpfully makes a ""suggestion"" to Bubba (Don Stark) and his pals that if an injury sidelined Stanley, there wouldn't be much anyone could do about it. Wow, what a bunch of jerks! This is only the beginning, however, as we soon learn that the entire school seems to have it in for this poor kid. Colonel Kincaid (Charles Tyner), the commandant of the academy, can't stand him either. Neither can Reverend Jameson (Joseph Cortese) or the alcoholic caretaker Sarge (R.G. Armstrong).<br /><br />Things start to look up for Coopersmith when he discovers a labyrinth of corridors underneath the school. Wouldn't you just know it? It turns out that the academy sits on the very site where Esteban and his followers established a church devoted to Satan. Stanley's discovery is in actuality Esteban's old haunt. Our hero finds a book written in Latin containing many conjurations and dark prayers, and it isn't too long before he's entering all of this stuff into his computer in an effort to discover what it means. Meanwhile, the torment continues. Bubba and his fellow goons destroy Stanley's class project, and physically assault him in the corridors every chance they get. Kincaid administers a whipping, and Jameson can barely look at the boy without cringing. Coopersmith's dark discoveries soon take on a vengeful tone as he begins actively collecting the necessary materials to cast a spell against his tormenters. The final straw occurs when Bubba and his friends perform an act so despicable against the only thing Coopersmith cares about in the entire world. From this point forward the gloves are off as ""Evilspeak"" turns into an unmitigated gorefest of epic proportions. Note to self: never pick on anyone again. EVER.<br /><br />""Evilspeak"" never lets us forget that Clint Howard is the star of the film. The camera rarely leaves him, which is a good thing because we see what a fine actor he is. Howard gives his put upon character great depth, makes us believe totally that he's a rather inept kid with a penchant for clumsiness yet deep inside is a good guy just looking to improve his lot in life. Stanley Coopersmith is so harassed that you can't help but root for him. Perhaps I should compliment the other actors at this point as well because they come across as the most unlikable bunch of cretins in B movie history, and that is exactly what the script called for them to do. I cheered at the end as Coopersmith took gory revenge against his oppressors. Speaking of the gore, ""Evilspeak"" contains several scenes of carnage and general mayhem rarely witnessed in American horror films. The pigs paying a visit to the secretary at her home should win some sort of award, but the real gooey stuff appears at the end. Imagine an airborne Clint Howard in devilish makeup slicing through heads and limbs with an enormous sword. Yep, it's gory, it's gluey, and it's great.<br /><br />A huge thanks goes out to Anchor Bay for releasing such a fine DVD version of the film. Extras include a commentary with Howard and director Eric Weston, poster stills, and a trailer. The commentary is a lot of fun due to Clint Howard's observations. He tells lots of great stories, including one about some problems he encountered with law enforcement when he wore his military uniform from the film to a Las Vegas casino several years later. Clint seems like a great guy and his enthusiasm for the film appears genuine. Weston and Howard even discuss the idea of making a sequel! It probably won't happen, but if it matches this film in the gore department I'll be the first one in line to see it.",0.52

(She'll get her act together eventually, but I digress.)  Plus, it contains a bit of licorice extract, which is also sweet.  One reviewer said it tastes bad, but I disagree wholeheartedly.<br /><br />What really cool is it contains no CAFFEINE, no PESTICIDES and no FLUORIDE.  That is hard to find:  a green tea in any form without fluoride (which we all know is bad for us).  So that's a great thing.<br /><br />I had no idea that green tea helps with joint pain and stiffness and arthritis, etc. beforehand.  I was taking it for weight loss and energy.  But I found it was making my joints feel much better, so I'm moving around more, exercising more and am sleeping like a Princess (however Princesses sleep...).  I guess my joint pain had crept up on me slowly over the years and I was assuming the sleep I was getting was ""normal,"" but when I took this stuff I noticed in only a week that I was pain free during sleep which made me realize my prior sleep condition was not ""normal"" at all.  Bingo, now that I'm getting better quality sleep, I'm less hungry, am moving more and have more energy.  This stuff is great.<br /><br />Previously, as someone on thyroid meds, I had to stay away from all the green teas out there because they contained fluoride (which works against thyroid meds).  Now I can get the benefits of green tea without the bad things that come from fluoride, and PESTICIDES and some of the other things that come along with the NON-ORGANIC green teas out there.  NOTE:  Not ALL organic green tea products are FLUORIDE FREE, but this one IS!<br /><br />This stuff is my new best buddy!

We had good results with that food and I even rated it here on Amazon at 5-stars. However, I believe that one of my Frenchies was developing an allergy to something in that food. Needless to say we decided to switch dog foods (again) and after doing much research stumbled onto Nature's Variety.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this dog food that in my opinion ranks it highly with other top-tier brands such as Orijen, Canidae, Innova and others. First, the formula is grain free - a must in my household. The main proteins used in the different formulas aren't by-product like in many mainstream brands. The first ingredients listed on the label are proteins and not fillers.<br /><br />The manufacturer claims that their formulas are meant to be interchangeable. In our household we have successfully been practicing rotation feeding with Nature's Variety Prairie formulas with very minimal side effects. With other brands we've used in the past rotation feeding has been very difficult even with gradual integration of the new food over a 2 week period.<br /><br />Lastly and maybe most importantly our dogs devour their food.

I found that wasn't enough water to mix it up properly and had to put in a little extra. Over time I've found 1T of water is needed for every 1T of powder (equal parts), and that provides a creamier texture.<br /><br />If I've got a few extra calories to burn for the day, I will sometimes mix 3T of PB2, 3T of water, and 1T of real peanut butter.<br /><br />So PB2 is a great product and it is helping me meet my diet goals, but I wish it tasted more like real peanut butter. I haven't tried it in smoothies or anything like that (because I don't drink them), but I can see how that could be good if you enjoy them. I've ordered some of the chocolate flavored and I look forward to trying it.",-0.47

I looked at the label - it says: ""feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight"".  So, it means that I need to give my 14 pounds cat 4 cans a day to maintain his present weight.  Usually when other pet food company says that, they are exaggerating and your pet can live on half the amount they recommended.  But it is not the case for Weruva, based on their website, the calorie content for the 5.5 ounce can is only 84 cal.  So, by doing a simple math, the calorie content for the 3oz can is only ~46 cal.  The ideal calorie intake for my 14 pounds cat is 195cal (formula: ideal weight (13 pounds) multiply by 15).  In other words, I need to feed my cat four 3oz can per day.  So, I need to spend $4 (3oz) per day on cat food (he lives on a non-kibble diet).  That is a lot of dough!!! And I can do better by making my own cat food or switch to another non-grain cat food brand.

(1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) ""price is no object"" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food.""  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6"">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.",0.62

If you don't use a machine that uses pods, you could brew it like a tea bag but you might get a more bitter brew with more residue. The pod machines are like espresso machines in that they pump very hot water, or steam, through the coffee.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that this coffee is 'organic.' I thought all foods were organic. If 'organic' means the coffee bushes were not treated with pesticides or fertilizers, that might affect the yield (and therefore the price) but how might that affect the flavor?<br /><br />The flavor is nice -- a little fruity. It has none of the bitter bite that's typical of espresso or dark roasted coffee. If you like strong coffee with chocolaty, full-body flavor that stands up to sugar and half-and-half, and can dissolve silver spoons, this is not for you.",0.53

First off, if you put this just in water, it tastes absolutely terrible.  Might as well throw some stevia in there.  Also, this stuff will cake on the sides of any glass or water bottle you put it into.

ONE strawberry.<br /><br />Overhyped, overpriced product.  Spend your money elsewhere.<br /><br />Update: 2/24/12: Sambazon must've changed the formulation.  The powder dissolves A LOT better than it used to. I got my hands on this product again after my original review, and I find that it mixes pretty well now.  It's still a little gritty, but not terribly bad.  Almost unnoticeable in a protein shake.  Problem is, this formula is only a 3g serving size.  That's 1 scoop.  When you use the frozen Acai packs, it's 25g.  Yes, a lot of that 25g is water, so you have to subtract some, but let's say it's 50% water, for arguments sake.  That will means 1 frozen pack is equivalent to 4 scoops of this Acai powder.  Since I realized that, I've been using 2-4 scoops of this stuff in a smoothie. NOW I feel the benefits.  1 scoop is nothing, and shouldn't be the serving size.  I recommend people start with 2 and work up to 4 scoops in their smoothies.  Then you'll notice the Acai benefits, if you didn't feel them before.",-0.95

So then I gave one to my dog. If he loves something, he will eat it immediately, barely taking time to chew it. If he does not like something he will go bury it and never bother eating it. If it's questionable, he plays with it for a few minutes, then either eats it or buries it. For this treat, he played with it for a few minutes.

Unless you Like to eat Mold,"Do not waste your money on the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake version, unless you like to eat mold! Just so you know, you won't easily be able to detect the mold except by taste. It shows up adjacent to the apples, and in the cinnamon strip in the center of the cake.<br /><br />The one star that I had to give Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake in my review was merited, however. I did not get sick from eating some of a piece of the coffee cake ... the phenolic flavor of which caused me to pull apart the cake, and identify that gray fuzziness which hallmarks mold. No diarrhea. No puking. Well worth one star.<br /><br />My story. The week after Thanksgiving (2009), I received one of the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cakes as a gift from my aunt. According to the label, she had purchased it the first week of November 2009 at Walter Reed Hospital (military) commissary. After detecting the mold, I resealed it in its packaging material, what the company describes as a reusable freezer bag. I placed it in my freezer, including the outer box, anticipating sending it back to the company for examination.<br /><br />A note about the packaging. When I first opened the coffee cake's box, the inner (reusable freezer) bag conformed tightly with the cake, and the tape sealing the bag was undisturbed. While the flyer included with the coffee cake advises that the product is stable for up to a year, I believe this could be overly optimistic if the mold eats cake quickly. On the bright side, as the mold progresses, it's likely to become more visible during the course of a year.<br /><br />Know that if you don't heed my warning you're on your own. The company will not stand by their product. When I called their 'customer service' number, the woman advised me to return it to the military commissary where my aunt purchased it. Not being in the military, I can not get on the facility within which the commissary is located. Further, I'm not the boorish type, so the idea of returning the gift to my aunt as inedible was not an option.<br /><br />As we spoke, the customer service woman asked me 'if I had a problem with Campbell's soup would I call Campbell's soup, or take the soup back to the grocery store?' I'd get in touch with Campbell's about defective soup ... if for no other reason than to allow them to recall the product. Bottom line, she could no nothing for me as I had not bought the coffee cake directly from My Grandma's.<br /><br />When I related to the customer service woman that I would endeavor to communicate my dissatisfaction with the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake, and their customer service, to the extent that I was able, she put me on hold. Twice she came back on the line, asking me to continue to hold ... advising that held calls could only stay on hold for a short while. The call disconnected after this.  There was no discussion on either of our parts with respect to the desired resolution. My only option for the moldy Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake was to return it.<br /><br />With natural foodstuffs, especially those not chock-full of preservatives, it seems likely that problems might crop up every now and again. I would've been content to ship the coffee-cake back to them (at their cost) to let their experts determine what was wrong, how it likely happened, and whether or not a recall was indicated ... after which I would've hoped for a replacement coffee cake.<br /><br />The crappy customer service ensured this didn't transpire.",0.49

This is an extremely fine blend of pear/broccoli/lemon juice concentrate (with a little added vitamin C). Baby would not likely reject this at all-no real hint that veggies are blended in with the fruit, whatsoever.  It is a very smooth, uniform consistency.<br /><br />I'm amazed to find that that such a superior taste is achieved without any fillers/thickeners, sweeteners/salt, dairy, egg, lactose, nut or gluten.<br /><br />Additionally, the packaging is described as being ""BPA Free,"" which is so important to us. We've already taken steps to minimize plastic storage in other areas by using glass jars to keep our leftovers in the fridge.  Unfortunately, glass isn't very convenient for packing on the go. I like that you don't have to deal with having to use glass jars to travel with baby by using this resealable, BPA free packaging.<br /><br />Great taste, convenience, quality ingredients and safe packaging...nothing is sacrificed with this product EXCEPT for the fact it comes at a higher cost along with a shorter shelf-life.<br /><br />At 12 4.5oz pouches, this price point (currently over $26) seems quite high, especially in an age where consumers have the option of making their own blended baby food at home-even using popular BPA free blenders/food processors on the market.<br /><br />However, this would be nice to use as a back-up if one would have to leave out quickly with baby without having the time/energy to blend and pack that day (have to blend on same day to preserve vitamins if it's not canned/vacuum sealed).  In that event, I can see the option of buying some.  Unfortunately, the shorter shelf-life (in my case, 5 mos. from receiving product) does not allow the typical household to take full advantage of this scenario in an especially cost effective way.",0.97

It's 100% pure Cocoa Butter so it has a wonderful faint chocolate smell, its hard, and a little waxy to the touch.  However, it works wonders for the skin if you know how to use it. I know some people had a hard time trying to figure out how to use it so I have provided some instructions if you want to try it.<br /><br />~First remove the chucks from the container and melt it down in a pot over a low flame.  Once the chucks of Cocoa Butter are completely melted turn the flame off to avoid the oil becoming too hot and popping.  Infuse with your favorite oil, just make sure it's all natural like i.e. ""grape seed oil"", ""emu oil"", or an ""olive oil"".  Pure in about 3/4 to 1/2 a cup of the oil with the melted Cocoa Butter.  Mix it in then put the mixture into a plastic container with a lid and put it in freezer over night.  In the morning you will have a softer more usable product the melts when you rub it in your hands.  Use it for your heals, knees, elbows, or all over for soft conditioned skin.  It absorbs fast and leaves your skin completely moisturized it's great for blending or fading dark spot and healing of stretch marks.  Enjoy!",0.96

I am new to this product, as we have just been adopted by a brother and sister pair. This is even better than the adult formula we were giving them in the mean time, because this satiates them by giving them more of what they need, so I actually have to feed them less.<br /><br />To those poo-pooing the fruits, veggies, seeds etc., the protein and fat content are the highest you can find outside of making it yourself, and you would still find yourself having to add these items. Even though cats are true carnivores and most wouldn't eat these other things by themselves in the wild, the fact is is that they DO eat non-meat items, when they eat their prey. They don't just eat muscle, they also eat the contents of the intestines, stomach, crops, and gizzards, and many try to get in the skull for the fats and lipids (because most wild prey will be very lean this is often the only place to get them). The trick is getting everything in the right proportions, and using actual, nutritious food.<br /><br />The price, yes, it is more.

This is the first and only negative review I have written.  I usually let little things go, and figure there was a glitch or tech issue.  But, the product was listed at that price for multiple days.  Fair advertising is something I expect from Amazon and all its suppliers.  This was clearly misleading, and very frustrating.

I just bought a bag of these from the grocery store after seeing them for the first time and I was so excited because they are my favorite part of the Gardetto's mix but it never has enough of them. Now I know why. I never realized just how bad they are for you, for just 1/2 cup you get 10 grams of fat, 3grams of that being Trans fat (the bad stuff), and while others have pointed out that it also contains MSG (Monosodium glutamate) studies have shown that it is perfectly safe [...] I'm more concerned about the high trans fat content and the overall high fat content, as well as the extremely high sodium content (320mg per serving). So while these rye chips are delicious, they aren't exactly the healthiest snack, far from it in fact. I'm not really sure why they are so high in fat, I mean you'd think baked rye bread chips wouldn't be so bad for you, but these really are terrible as far as health is concerned. It just isn't worth it for me because I already need to drop about 30lbs and these will not help matters, so I need to find a healthier snack. Having said that, they are REALLY tasty. I guess you just need to decide whether they're worth it, but if you do decide to buy them then please be sure to enjoy in moderation, your arteries will thank you.",0.37
55591,0,12.0,Female,4.0,0,13.0,3.0,12.0,257.06,I Thought I Hated Coconut Water (Until Zico Chocolate!),"Having heard many people express their undying love for coconut water, last year I decided to try some. After about the first sip of the plain unadulterated coconut water I got at the grocery store I knew it and I were not going to be friends. I couldn't even force myself to finish the carton. I could not figure out why everyone was so excited about it and decided it just wasn't for me. Then, one day earlier this month I saw Zico Chocolate in the cold case at a convenience store, sandwiched between juices and sports drinks. I was hesitant to buy it considering my previous experience with coconut water but the lure of chocolate was too much. I am so glad that I decided to go for it! Zico Chocolate could not be more different from plain coconut water. The weird (almost like bad molasses) flavor I found so unappealing in the plain was missing completely from the Zico Chocolate. Because they added some coconut cream it is ever so mildly creamy and the chocolate is nice and rich like semisweet dark chocolate. Just like plain coconut water it has an enticing naturally occurring nutrient content including some calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, vitamin A, and phosphorus. The only nutritional downside is that there is some added sugar, bringing the total sugar for one 14 oz bottle up to 18 grams. However, for me drinking a Zico Chocolate is often a replacement for either a dessert or a sweetened iced tea so I'm not really ingesting any more sugar than I normally would be. If you don't mind the added sugar and/or haven't been pleased with the taste of other coconut water I highly recommend trying Zico Chocolate.<br /><br />This last bit is about buying from Amazon and not about the product itself. This is the first time I've bought this particular product from Amazon and I am very happy with the purchase. It cost me significantly less per bottle to have it shipped by the case from Amazon using subscribe & save than it costs to buy in any store near me ($.75 - $1.00 less per bottle).

Thanks.",0.99

Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house.",0.97

Subtract the fiber from the carbs and you got a negligible amount of carbs.  Theres no junk in these like other flax crackers, that often have some type of grain flour added.  These are pretty much as flaxy as you can get without making them yourself.  The italian zest is my 2nd favorite flavor of this product line, right behind the mexican harvest.",0.96

My 60 lb. mostly Dingo mix's strategy is to pick it up by the bottle and let it drop on the rope. When the rope hits the ground a few kibbled treats are released. This was tough for him to figure out. However, he has many different feeding toys and he doesn't give up.",0.56
